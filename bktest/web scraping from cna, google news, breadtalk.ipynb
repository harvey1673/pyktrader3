      " news title: Singapore to waive stay-home notice for New Zealand and Brunei travellers, will test them for COVID-19 on arrival\n",
      "SINGAPORE: From Sep 1, some travellers coming to Singapore from Brunei and New Zealand will not be required to serve a stay-home notice but will take a COVID-19 test upon arrival instead, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Aug 21). At the same time, Singapore will update its travel advisory for people who want to visit these countries. Under the current advisory, residents are advised to defer all travel abroad, except for essential business and official travel under green-lane and fast-lane arrangements.  The advisory will be updated to allow general travel to Brunei and New Zealand, said MOH on Friday. People visiting these two countries are advised to check the entry requirements imposed by the respective governments, as well as take the necessary precautions. Co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong said during a press conference on Friday that the arrangements with Brunei and New Zealand are not reciprocal, but discussions with both countries are ongoing. “When we are ready with the reciprocal green lane arrangements with these two countries, we will announce the details,” he said. \"Specific to these two countries, we are making a move based on the evidence, based on our assessment of risk,\" he added.  The travel advisory will also be updated to allow students pursuing academic qualifications overseas to travel for studies, if distance-learning is not offered as an option. “When overseas, travellers should take all necessary precautions, observe good personal hygiene, monitor local developments, and heed the advice of local authorities,” MOH said.  Health Minister Gan Kim Yong urged those who are intending to travel to plan ahead. \"Don't just hop on the plane and go. Please check what are the requirements of the destination countries, make sure that you comply with the requirements before you fly over. \"At the same time when you're there, continue to exercise vigilance, continue to exercise safe distancing, and also observe the safe distancing rules in those countries, so that you protect yourself and protect others,\" he added. Those who comply with the travel advisories will be eligible for Government subsidies and MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plan coverage for their COVID-19 treatment should they have onset of symptoms within 14 days of their return to Singapore and require hospital admission for suspected infection, said MOH. Singaporeans and residents of Singapore are advised to defer all other forms of travel overseas, the health ministry added. BRUNEI, NEW ZEALAND TRAVELLERS TESTED ON ARRIVAL Since Jun 18, travellers from low-risk countries and regions – Australia (excluding Victoria State), Brunei Darussalam, Macau, Mainland China, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam – have been allowed to serve their 14-day stay-home notice at their own place of residence.  They are also tested before the end of their stay-home notice. \"Amongst these low-risk countries, we will start by lifting our current border restrictions to allow the entry of visitors from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand into Singapore,\" said MOH. Travellers entering Singapore and who have remained in either Brunei or New Zealand in the past 14 consecutive days will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival at the airport, instead of serving the 14-day stay-home notice.  They must test negative for the coronavirus before being allowed to go about their activities in Singapore. Visitors from these two countries will need to apply for an Air Travel Pass between seven and 30 days before their intended date of entry into Singapore. They can apply for the pass from Sep 1, for travel from Sep 8. \"They will be responsible for their medical bills should they require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore,\" MOH said.  Returning Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders will not have to serve a stay-home notice and will undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival. They do not need to apply for the Air Travel Pass.  \"We have monitored the situation and assessed that there are several countries/regions where the virus situation is well under control and the risk of importation is low. We will therefore update our border measures accordingly,\" explained MOH. According to New Zealand’s immigration website, the country’s border is closed to \"almost all travellers\". \"The starting point for consideration is that the New Zealand border is closed for all but critical travel, and that protecting public health in New Zealand is paramount,\" the website said. Foreigners who want to enter New Zealand must first seek approval and prove that they are entering for “critical purposes”, the guidelines state. Brunei’s tourism website, updated on Aug 15, states that all visitors will be denied entry from all ports of entry. This includes visitors on transit.  SHORTER STAY-HOME NOTICES FOR SOME TRAVELLERS Travellers coming from some low-risk countries and regions will have their stay-home notices reduced from 14 days to seven days. The isolation period can be served at their place of residence.  These countries and regions are Australia (excluding Victoria State), Macau, Mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. They will be tested before the end of the isolation period. All other incoming travellers will continue to serve their 14-day stay-home notices at dedicated isolation facilities, and will be subject to a COVID-19 test before the end of the notices. \"There are other low-risk countries or regions where a stay-home notice may also not be needed. But out of abundance of caution we will keep the stay-home notice for now,\" said MOH. Existing travel conditions, including adhering to stay-home notice requirements and applying for relevant approval before entering Singapore, continue to apply. Those serving such notices are reminded to only use permitted modes of transport and avoid taking public transport. \"All travellers will be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated stay-home facilities and tests, where applicable,\" said MOH. MOH said Singapore's border measures will \"evolve as the global situation changes\".  If the COVID-19 situation in certain countries deteriorate, more stringent measures will be put in place to \"limit the risk of importation and prevent community transmission from imported cases\".

      " news title: COVID-19: Lucky Plaza, Peninsula Plaza to implement odd and even date entry restrictions on weekends \n",
      "SINGAPORE: Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza will soon implement odd and even date entry restrictions on weekends, to better manage crowds and ensure that safe distancing can be observed, announced Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong on Friday (Aug 21). From Aug 29, those whose NRIC or FIN numbers end in even digits (0,2,4,6,8) can only visit the two malls on even dates on weekends, while those whose numbers end in odd digits (1,3,5,7,9) can only do so on odd dates. This will only be in place on Saturdays and Sundays. Speaking at a COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce press conference, Mr Gan noted that where “persistent non-adherence” to COVID-19 measures is observed, the Government will continue to tighten requirements.    “We did something similar for our more popular markets recently, so it is a system that we are familiar with,” said Mr Gan, adding that the task force will continue to monitor the situation, and that other premises that face similar crowd management issues may also be required to adopt this entry restriction if necessary. “These measures illustrate the approach we have adopted, which is to regularly calibrate our measures to balance the risk of transmission and facilitating a new COVID normal situation,” said Mr Gan.  Mr Gan also urged the public to stay vigilant and “not let up on the discipline” developed over these few months. “This way, we can keep our case numbers down and keep our families, our friends and fellow Singaporeans safe.”   Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza, which are popular with foreign domestic workers in Singapore, attract large crowds and long queues during weekends, when helpers typically take their rest days.  The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said in a joint press release on Friday evening that Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza typically reach their maximum occupancy limits by noon on Sundays, resulting in long queues forming at the entrances. This disrupts pedestrian flow and causes large crowds to spill over, they added.  “Members of the public also congregate outside the malls, further disrupting the pedestrian flow,” said STB and ESG, adding that they have worked with both malls to improve the flow and demarcation of queues.  “Neighbouring malls have also been engaged to help disperse crowds which congregate outside their malls, by cordoning off public seating and stepping up patrols.”  With the odd and even date entry restrictions in place, all visitors must produce appropriate identification at the entrance of the two malls, and those who cannot do so will be denied entry, said STB and ESG.   “STB and ESG will continue to explore other longer-term measures to reduce the crowds at both malls. These include stepping up public education and intensifying enforcement efforts where required.”  Mr Alan Yeo, ESG’s director for retail and design said: “The entry restriction measure implemented at popular wet markets has been effective in evening out the crowds. With the entry restriction implementation at Lucky Plaza and Peninsular Plaza, we hope that it will help these popular malls to reduce crowding issues on the weekends and provide a safer shopping environment for all.”  In their press release, STB and ESG also urged businesses to continue adhering to safe management measures, including the implementation of SafeEntry, ensuring proper queue markings and crowd control during peak periods, and ensuring patrons and employees wear their masks appropriately.  “Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s safe distancing advisories may be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance,” added the agencies.

      " news title: Households with more than 5 people may book more than 1 table in F&B outlets; more exercise classes in open spaces\n",
      "SINGAPORE: Households with more than five people who would like to dine out may book more than one table, said co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce Lawrence Wong on Friday (Aug 21). However, they should limit interaction between tables, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release. Members of the public should refrain from booking multiple tables for large gatherings in F&B outlets, and operators at these places should not accept such reservations, said Mr Wong, who is also the Minister for Education. “Other than that, there should not be organised events, celebrations or parties in an F&B setting involving multiple tables,” he said. This is because people in these gatherings tend to mingle without masks on, causing a risk of large clusters forming. In addition, recorded music can only be played in F&B outlets as soft background music, said Mr Wong.  “We have observed some F&B outlets where the recorded music, the piped music, is being played quite loudly, and this is a concern because of the risk of people speaking loudly and droplets spreading, especially when diners are in a restaurant, in close proximity within a table, without their mask on,” he said. He added that live music, live broadcasts and video screenings are still not allowed. Mr Wong announced in June that diners may sit in groups of five at a table, during Phase 2 of Singapore's reopening, but the tables must be spaced 1m apart.   MORE EXERCISE CLASSES IN OPEN SPACES More public facilities will also be available for those conducting outdoor exercise classes from Sep 1, including open spaces at SportSG centres and Housing and Development Board (HDB) common areas. “Currently, we allow organised exercise classes to be conducted in selected venues,” said Mr Wong, subject to a class size of up to 50 people, with safe distancing between individuals and groups of five. The classes must be organised by an instructor who will ensure there are safe management measures in place including temperature screening, safe distancing and maintaining a list of participants in venues without the SafeEntry digital check-in system. The detailed requirements will be announced at a later date by SportSG. Instructors must be registered to conduct these activities and more details on the registration process will also be released. Organised exercise classes conducted by instructors in private and public sports facilities were allowed to resume since the start of Phase 2. Activities are limited to groups of five, with a 2m safe distancing between individuals or 3m between groups, and up to a total class size of 50 people or lower, depending on the venue capacity and safe distancing measures.  Watch the full news conference and Q&A session: ​​​​​​​  Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n",

      " news title: SIA, Changi Airport welcome Government's decision to ease some COVID-19 travel restrictions\n",
      "SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) have welcomed the Government's decision on Friday (Aug 21) to ease restrictions on inbound travel from Brunei and New Zealand.  From Sep 1, some travellers coming to Singapore from those two countries will not be required to serve a stay-home notice but will instead take a COVID-19 test upon arrival. \"The recovery of air travel and airfreight is a necessary catalyst for the recovery of global trade and economies severely impacted by COVID-19,\" said SIA Group. \"Today’s announcement is an important step towards the gradual rebuilding of the Singapore air hub. The SIA Group will continue to work closely with the Singapore government and all stakeholders to support this.\" SIA, SilkAir and Scoot accounted for more than half of the passengers flying in and out of Changi Airport in the last financial year. With the easing of restrictions, SIA Group said it will work closely with the authorities to safeguard the health and safety of its customers, employees and communities it operates in. CAG said it looks forward to welcoming tourists and leisure visitors to Singapore again. \"CAG welcomes today’s announcement on the opening of inbound leisure travel from New Zealand and Brunei,\" said spokesman Ivan Tan. \"This is indeed good news for Changi Airport, and it is an encouraging start to what we hope will be a gradual resumption of air travel to and from Singapore,\" he added. \"The health and safety of staff and visitors at Changi Airport remain a priority for us. We will work closely with the various government agencies and our airport partners to facilitate the safe travel processes at Changi when we receive visitors from these two countries.\" The COVID-19 pandemic has battered the aviation and travel industry worldwide. In July, SIA Group reported a S$1.12 billion net loss in the first quarter after drastically cutting capacity due to travel restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Figures released on Monday showed that three of the group's carriers continue to see sharp declines in passenger traffic for July.  \"The SIA Group will continue to closely monitor the demand for international air travel, and be nimble and flexible in adjusting our capacity to match this,\" it said on Friday. Singapore will also update its travel advisory for people who want to visit Brunei and New Zealand - to allow general travel to the two countries. However, they should check the entry requirements imposed by the respective governments. Under Singapore's current advisory, residents are advised to defer all travel abroad, except for essential business and official travel under green-lane and fast-lane arrangements.  Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n",

      " news title: 'Way beyond my budget': Malaysians entering Singapore for work under PCA scramble to find rental options\n",
      "SINGAPORE: Ms Norashikin Rahman is worried she may not have a shelter over her head next month. The 29-year-old Malaysian, who lives in Johor Bahru, is scheduled to enter Singapore via the Periodic Commutive Arrangement (PCA) scheme on Sep 1. The scheme allows her to resume work for her company, a computer chip manufacturing firm based in the north-eastern part of Singapore.   As part of the PCA, she will serve a seven day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival, at a facility paid for by her company, and undertake a COVID-19 swab test. After she finishes her SHN and tests negative for COVID-19, Ms Norashikin would need to move to a place to stay. The mother of two young children has been trying for weeks to secure a suitable room that is close to her work place and within her budget, but to no success. “My budget is only S$300, but for rooms in Yishun, the rent I have been quoted for are at least S$650. “The prices quoted are way beyond my budget. I won’t have enough money for my family or my living expenses in Singapore,” she said when interviewed by CNA. Ms Norashikin is one of many Malaysians who are heading to Singapore to resume work under the ambit of the PCA, but are struggling to find suitable homes on short notice, at the right price and with short rental leases. Some of them are using social media groups to find rental options and connect with other Malaysians looking to rent rooms at similar locations.   For instance, the Facebook group Bilik Sewa Singapore (Malaysian), or rooms for rent in Singapore for Malaysians, has been abuzz with many posts in recent weeks, with people looking for roommates and landlords posting rental opportunities. Although there are options available, Ms Norashikin said many landlords are looking for tenants who are willing to commit for between six months to a year. She is not willing to do this as she plans to return home after three months. Subsequently, she is hoping that the two governments can find a solution to resume daily commuting across the border. “For the long term, I don’t think I want to continue renting here. It’s important for me to be close to my child and family and see them every day,” she said. Another Malaysian who will also be entering Singapore to work via PCA in September is Mr Fakhrul Adlee, who works in the western part of Singapore. He told CNA that he has been looking for suitable rental options on the Bilik Sewa Singapore Facebook group for a couple of weeks but has found it “challenging”. He noted that there were limited options for rooms in the area he wants to stay in – near Jurong East or Toh Guan. “Also, the rent quoted is quite high. My budget is S$350, slightly flexible, but so far nothing falls into the range I can afford,” he said. Mr Fakhrul added that many of the options available were only for female tenants, and virtually none for males. RENT ON THE RISE FOR UNITS NEAR INDUSTRIAL AREAS: PROPERTY ANALYSTS  According to Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Realty's research and consultancy head, Malaysian workers who are looking for rental units are typically “more budget conscious”. He also said that a total of six tenants would usually share an entire HDB unit to lower costs. Moreover, there has been an increase in demand for HDB rental units recently, especially near industrial estates in Jurong, Tuas, Woodlands, Yishun and Kaki Bukit, he said. “Malaysians who are coming here to work is a big factor in driving up demand for these units. They are far from the city centre and are popular among Malaysian workers, who prefer to live in a place easily accessible to their places of work,” added Mr Mak.   He said that this has led to some landlords in these areas raising the prices. “For example, the rent for a 4-room HDB unit in Joo Koon would typically cost around S$2,300 but recently, the prices have spiked to around S$2,700. This price is what you usually see for flats closer to the city.” Ms Christine Sun, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said that the increase in HDB rental demand can be linked to Malaysians working in Singapore. “Anecdotally, we have observed strong rental demand from Malaysians working in Singapore since the start of the circuit breaker period. “Even now, with some of the border lockdowns being eased recently, many are still reluctant to travel back as they need to serve their stay-home-notice and have continued to rent a unit in Singapore,” she added. According to SRX flash estimates released on Aug 12, the prices for the HDB rental market in July increased by 1.4 per cent from June. Ms Sun said this was possibly due to landlords raising their rent after observing a sudden surge in demand. Malaysian worker Imran Malik told CNA that he is due to enter Singapore via PCA in two weeks but he is “feeling anxious” because he believes the higher demand has priced him out of the market. “It’s obvious, many of the landlords have noticed an increase in demand for their units so they upped their asking price. Some have even refused to reply to my queries to negotiate price,” he said. “And to share a room, they are charging around S$700. It’s not worth it because some of them have no air-con even,” added Mr Imran. The issue of Malaysian workers having difficulties finding temporary shelter in Singapore first surfaced in March, after the Malaysia government imposed the Movement Control Order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Under the order, all Malaysians were barred from travelling abroad, including around 300,000 Malaysians who travel across the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link every day for work.  It was then reported that some Malaysian workers who had crossed over to Singapore before the travel restrictions kicked in were unable to find accommodation. Subsequently, Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it found 14 Malaysian workers who were sleeping rough at Kranji MRT station and took them to a \"temporary relief centre\" in Jurong East. Ms Sun of OrangTee & Tie said if the landlords and tenants can find an equilibrium now, it may help to prop up Singapore's property market going forward. “We have quite a number of Malaysians working in Singapore. Therefore, the PCA and some lockdown restrictions that are still currently in place may deter Malaysians from going back. This will continue to prop up the rental market in Singapore,” she said. However, she noted that the long term future of these workers might not be secure given how COVID-19 has impacted the Singapore economy. “There will also be other considerations such as whether the economic uncertainties will impact the job security and employment of Malaysian workers in Singapore,” Ms Sun noted.

      " news title: National year-end exams to proceed, students with COVID-19 or in isolation not allowed to sit for exams\n",
      "SINGAPORE: The national year-end exams in Singapore will proceed amid the COVID-19 pandemic with safe management measures in place, but students who have COVID-19 or are in isolation will not be allowed to sit for the exams.  “The national examinations are an integral part of teaching and learning, and we also know that the results of the national examinations are important for the progression of the students to the next phase of their educational journey,” said director-general of education Wong Siew Hoong on Friday (Aug 21). He assured parents and students that “very strict safe management measures” will be in place during the exams. The written exams will be held from Sep 14 to Oct 16 for N-Level students, the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) from Oct 1 to Oct 7, O-Levels from Oct 19 to Nov 12 and A-Levels from Oct 26 to Dec 2. According to figures provided by MOE, about 98,000 graduating candidates will take the national year-end examinations this year. An additional 22,000 candidates who are not from graduating cohorts will also sit for their respective O-Level and A-Level examinations.    Safe management measures include temperature taking and visual screening of all candidates, designated toilets or staggered toilet breaks, as well as staggered dismissal timings and segregated entry and exit routes. All candidates will wear face masks when reporting to the exam venue, and can replace them with face shields when seated at their desks, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) in a press release. “However, they must put on the face masks when they leave the examination venue, such as for visits to the toilet or at the end of the examination,” they said. Students will be seated 1.5m apart from one another, with up to 30 in each classroom. Larger venues like school halls will be zoned, with up to 50 candidates in each zone and at least 3m space between zones. Each venue will have a maximum of 250 candidates. All schools have been encouraged to implement a “study break” for this year’s graduating cohort ahead of the exams, said MOE in a media briefing on Friday. This is to minimise the risk of a big number of students having to be quarantined or put on leave of absence as a result of COVID-19 cases in schools. The length of the study break will be decided by the schools, depending on the profile and needs of the students as well as existing school practices, added the ministry. EXCEPTIONS FOR CANDIDATES IN ISOLATION ON “CASE-BY-CASE BASIS” To “ensure they do not pose a risk to others”, students with COVID-19, or who have been placed on quarantine order, stay-home notice or leave of absence will not be allowed to sit for the exams, MOE and SEAB said. Exceptions can be made “on a case-by-case basis” for those on stay-home notice who travelled out of Singapore for compassionate reasons, such as to attend a funeral or visit a critically ill next-of-kin, said the education ministry. Those allowed to take the exams will sit for the papers in a centralised venue managed by SEAB, individually in a room and not allowed to mingle with other candidates. The room will also be thoroughly wiped down after each paper. They will also not be allowed to take public transport to the exam venue, and will have to take their own private vehicles or pre-booked taxis, said the press release. Invigilators will be provided with personal protective equipment and will oversee the exam from outside the room to minimise contact with candidates. Candidates who are on leave of absence due to close contact with COVID-19 cases will not be allowed to sit for the exams. However, those who are on leave of absence because they stay in the same household as someone in quarantine will be allowed to take the exams if they test negative for the coronavirus. Other candidates who are on medical leave due to acute respiratory infections will also be allowed to sit for the examinations if they test negative. STUDENTS WITH RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS TO BE TESTED FOR COVID-19  Currently, people aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first presentation to a doctor are tested for COVID-19. From Sep 17, 14 days before the start of the PSLE written exams, students taking the papers this year will also be tested for COVID-19 at first presentation of acute respiratory infection before and during the exam period, said MOE and SEAB. “This will allow for the early detection of candidates with an active COVID-19 infection,” they said. Students will not have to pay for the swab tests, said MOE. The cost of the tests arising from a diagnosis of acute respiratory infection will be paid for by the Government if they visit a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) or a polyclinic.  \"After government subsidies, students who are Singapore citizens and permanent residents will pay a flat subsidised rate of S$10, which covers the consultation, medication and investigations, including the swab,\" said MOE.  \"International students will not need to pay for the swab but will need to pay for consultation and medication, subject to the charges of their chosen medical clinic.\" An exception will be made for PSLE students seeking urgent medical attention at KKH from Sep 28 to Oct 7, or just before the examinations begin and throughout the examination period, said the education ministry. MOE will bear the consultation fees as they will be significantly higher, at about S$120.  The cost of the tests for students who are placed on leave of absence because they live with an individual on home quarantine order will also be covered by MOE. Students on approved absence due to staying in the same household as adults with flu-like symptoms will be allowed to sit for the exams with enhanced safe management measures in place. These enhanced measures, which will also apply to candidates who are on leave of absence or medical leave but allowed to take the exams, include seating them in a separate room from other candidates. They will be seated at least 3m apart with a maximum of 10 candidates per room. “Precautionary measures will also be taken to ensure that these candidates do not mingle with the other candidates, including designated toilets, separate entry and exit routes for each examination room with deconflicted arrival and departure timings,” MOE and SEAB said.   Those who miss the national examinations “with valid reasons” can apply for special consideration. “All special consideration applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis and subjected to a rigorous review process,” the press release said. “Special consideration is actually a post-examination adjustment of marks to the candidates who are being affected by the exam due to the adverse circumstances. What we will do is to consider multiple sources of information to make sure that these candidates will not be affected and they’ll be given a fair grade,” said SEAB chief executive Yue Lip Sin. The board will consider evidence of the candidate’s performance from sources such as his performance in the other papers for the affected subject in the national and school-based exams, as well as the school cohort's performance in the national and school-based exams. “We urge all candidates and staff to continue practising good personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility,” MOE and SEAB said, adding that they will monitor the COVID-19 situation and provide updates if there are changes to the exam arrangements.

      " news title: FAQ: Special arrangements for the year-end national examinations\n",
      "SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) have announced that the national year-end exams will proceed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with special arrangements to keep students safe. The written exams will be held from Sep 14 to Oct 16 for N-Level students, while the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will take place between Oct 1 and Oct 7. Exams for O-Levels will be from Oct 19 to Nov 12 and A-Levels from Oct 26 to Dec 2.  Safe management measures, including temperature taking and safe distancing, will be put in place for candidates taking the examinations.   Here are some frequently asked questions based on information released by MOE and SEAB so far.  Q: How and where can students get tested for COVID-19?  A: Candidates who are on leave of absence because they stay in the same household as individuals on quarantine will be allowed to sit for the examinations if they test negative for COVID-19, said MOE and SEAB on Friday. Other candidates who are on medical leave due to acute respiratory infection will also be allowed to sit for the examinations if they test negative for COVID-19.  Currently, individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first presentation to a doctor are tested for COVID-19.  From Sep 17, 14 days before the start of the PSLE written examinations, students taking the papers this year will also be tested for COVID-19 at first presentation of acute respiratory infection before and during the examination period.  A graduating student who is unwell, especially with respiratory symptoms, should see a doctor at a General Practitioner (GP) clinic participating in the Swab-and-Send-Home (SASH) initiative, or a polyclinic. A list of GP clinics participating in the SASH initiative can be found at www.phpc.gov.sg. If diagnosed by the doctor to have acute respiratory infection, the student will be tested for COVID-19. PSLE students who display symptoms close to the examination date from Sep 28 and during the examination period should seek medical attention at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH).  This is to ensure timely diagnosis and notification of results, should they be diagnosed with acute respiratory infection and need to be tested for COVID-19. Students taking the N-, O- or A-Level exams who display symptoms close to the examination date, or four days before the start of their exams, should seek medical attention at polyclinics to ensure timely diagnosis and notification of results.  While awaiting notification of the COVID-19 swab test results, students must stay home and will not be allowed to enter the examination venue.  Students aged 16 years and younger should be accompanied by an adult for the swab test. This facilitates consent-taking and communication to both the student and accompanying adult on the precautions to take note of while awaiting the test results at home. Q: As national examinations are essential for progression, can special provisions or alternative arrangements be made, such as online invigilation for candidates who are confirmed cases or who are on stay-home notice and home quarantine order? A: As online invigilation essentially involves candidates taking examinations at home, the fairness and integrity of the national examinations may be compromised, said MOE and SEAB.  There are no plans for online invigilation arrangements, they added. “It is also important for us to consider the challenges faced in the management and provision of resources for online invigilation, given that it involves the administration of the examinations in individuals’ homes.” Q: What happens if there is a confirmed case in a school during the national examinations? A: If there is any confirmed cases in a school during the national examinations period, all close contacts of the confirmed cases will be identified, and schools may suspend classes and activities for disinfection and deep cleaning of affected areas, as well as for contact tracing investigations to be completed.  Special consideration will be applied for affected students to ensure that they are not disadvantaged for the national examinations. Students who are unaffected will either continue to take their examinations in another classroom block within the school, or in an examination venue managed by SEAB. Q: Will the year-end national examinations be called off or postponed if we enter another \"circuit breaker\", or if the COVID-19 situation worsens? In this case, how will candidates be assessed? A: Postponing or cancelling the examinations would be a last resort, said MOE and SEAB. Should the COVID-19 situation worsen considerably, and it is necessary to enter another circuit breaker, MOE and SEAB will review their plans in tandem with the national posture. Q: Will special arrangements be made for candidates taking the year-end Science practical examinations as well? What will be the safe management measures in place? A: The same arrangements will apply for the year-end Science practical examinations – candidates who are confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection or on quarantine order, stay-home notice or leave of absence due to close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases will not be allowed to sit for the practical examinations.  Candidates who had travelled out of Singapore for compassionate reasons and were placed on stay-home notice will also not be allowed to sit for the examinations. This is because the conduct of the Science practical examinations requires unique equipment and logistics, such as a science laboratory, said MOE and SEAB.  Candidates who miss the examinations can apply for special consideration. Similarly, candidates on leave of absence because they stay with individuals on home quarantine order or those diagnosed with acute respiratory infection will be allowed to sit for the science practical examinations if they test negative for COVID-19.  Similar safe management measures will be implemented for the practical examinations. These candidates will take their science practical examinations in the last shift and will be assigned to a separate laboratory with a cap of 10 candidates per science laboratory, instead of 20. They will also be seated 3m apart. The arrival and dismissal time, as well as reporting areas, will be deconflicted to reduce intermingling between different groups of candidates.   Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n",

      " news title: 117 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, including 6 in the community\n",
      "SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 117 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Friday (Aug 21), including six in the community and 13 imported infections, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).  This brings the country's tally of cases to 56,216.  Three of the community cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents, while the other three involve work pass holders, said MOH in its preliminary daily update. The 13 imported cases had all been placed on stay-home notice after arriving in Singapore.  More details will be announced later on Friday, the ministry added.  RESTRICTIONS EASED FOR SOME TRAVELLERS Singapore announced on Friday that it is easing some border controls to allow visitors from Brunei and New Zealand.  Those who have remained in those two countries in the last consecutive 14 days before entering Singapore will not be required to serve a stay-home notice from Sep 1. Instead they will take a COVID-19 test at Changi Airport, and only be allowed to go around Singapore after receiving a negative result. For travellers from other \"low-risk\" countries or regions - mainland China, Macau, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Australia (excluding Victoria state) - the stay-home duration will be reduced from 14 days to seven.  Other measures announced by the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce on Friday include the introduction of odd and even date entry restrictions on weekends at Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza, to better manage crowds. From Aug 29, those whose NRIC or FIN numbers end in even digits (0,2,4,6,8) can only visit the two malls on even dates on weekends, while those whose numbers end in odd digits (1,3,5,7,9) can only do so on odd dates. Meanwhile, more public facilities will be available from Sep 1 for registered instructors conducting outdoor exercise classes, including open spaces at SportSG centres and common areas managed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). It was also announced that households with more than five people can book more than one table at food and beverage outlets, but they should limit interaction between tables. Earlier on Friday, the Ministry of Education and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board said that the national year-end exams will proceed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with special arrangements to keep students safe. Students with COVID-19, or who have been placed on quarantine order, stay-home notice or leave of absence will not be allowed to sit for the exams. In the continued effort to understand the virus and develop treatments, researchers in Singapore have discovered a new COVID-19 variant that causes less severe symptoms in patients, opening up new avenues for vaccine development and treatments. Patients who had contracted the milder variant were less likely to develop low blood oxygen or required intensive care, according to a study released on Friday by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, A*STAR’s Singapore Immunology Network and Duke-NUS Medical School.

      " news title: Singapore researchers discover milder COVID-19 strain, opening up new avenues for treatment and vaccine development\n",
      "SINGAPORE: Researchers in Singapore have discovered a new COVID-19 variant that causes less severe symptoms in patients, opening up new avenues for vaccine development and treatments. The variant of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - was first detected in Singapore in three patients who had arrived from Wuhan in the early stage of the pandemic. It was later transmitted across several clusters in Singapore before being contained, said the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), A*STAR’s Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN) and Duke-NUS Medical School in a press briefing on Friday (Aug 21). Patients who had contracted the milder variant were less likely to develop low blood oxygen or required intensive care, according to the study. The findings were recently published in international scientific journal The Lancet. While the variant has stopped circulating in Singapore since early March, NCID executive director Prof Leo Yee Sin said the discovery has large implications for researchers’ understanding of the virus, and therapeutic and vaccine development. LESS SEVERE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS The milder variant has a large mutation or deletion in a region of the virus known as ORF8. In a sample of 39 patients with the milder variant, three patients developed low blood oxygen and required supplemental oxygen, compared with 26 out of 92 patients with the non-mutated or wild-type virus. Even adjusting for other factors including age, gender and chronic medical conditions, patients with the deletion variant showed less severe symptoms, said NCID consultant Dr Barnaby Young. Researchers studied 131 people infected with either the wild-type, the deletion variant or a mix of both types of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Data suggests that ORF8 deletions emerge in response to the human immune system response. Other types of deletions in the ORF8 region have also been detected globally. However, Prof Gavin Smith from the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programmes from Duke-NUS Medical School stressed that “it’s not unusual for different variants, or different versions of a virus to be generated throughout the course of an outbreak”.  Similar deletions in ORF8 were also detected in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, but the exact function of the ORF8 protein is obscure, the institutes said in a press release. “I will tell you that there is (a lot of) excitement among us, as researchers, when we found this new variant. It opens up a lot of scientific basis and background for us to understand, each genetic segment, what it means to the virus, and what it means when it interacts with the human host,” said Prof Leo. \"At least with this point, we understand with the deletions of these particular regions, the disease is actually milder in manifestations,” she added. The discovery will allow researchers to target that region with medication, said Prof Leo, adding that the information could also support vaccine development. “It’s very exciting … It opens up a lot of areas of investigation for a pathogen that we still don’t know an awful lot about,” said Prof Smith. Further studies to understand the function of the ORF8 protein and the effects of removing this protein are ongoing.

      " news title: Hong Kong to begin mass COVID-19 testing on Sep 1, says Carrie Lam\n",
      "HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Friday (Aug 21) that mass testing of residents for COVID-19 will begin on Sep 1, as she warned people not to be complacent despite a steady fall in the number of new infections. The testing, which will be done with the assistance of a 60-person team from the mainland, is the first time Chinese health officials have assisted the special administrative region in its battle to control the epidemic. Hong Kong has seen another wave of COVID-19 cases - blamed on exemptions from quarantine rules for air and ship crews, and some business travellers. According to the government's COVID-19 website, the city has reported more than 4,600 COVID-19 cases and 75 deaths. \"There is still quite a number of silent transmitters in the community,\" Lam said. \"So the more that we could test ... the earlier we could find the remaining outstanding cases,\" she added, appealing to residents to take part. The testing will be voluntary and take around two weeks to complete, Lam said. \"There will be a substantial boosting of the testing capacity in the public and private sector, a more than 10-fold increase,\" the chief executive said. Health minister Sophia Chan previously told a radio show she hoped 5 million people would participate in the mass testing. But Lam on Friday said the government has set \"no targets\" for the scheme that will be conducted by Hong Kong subsidiaries of three mainland firms, including Chinese genomics firm BGI Group. On Monday, the government announced an extension to social distancing measures aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19. These restrictions include a ban on dining at restaurants from 6pm, and the mandating of masks in all outdoor public areas. They are set to remain in force until Aug 25. \"In extending the social distancing measures, the government has balanced the ... competing factors of public health protection, economic impact and social acceptance,\" said a food and health bureau spokesperson on Monday. \"At present, the severe epidemic situation does not allow any room to relax social distancing measures.\" EXPANDED TESTING FOR SOME GROUPS A spokesperson for the food and health bureau on Monday appealed for people's continued cooperation and reassured them of the government's containment efforts. \"We understand that people are getting impatient over the prolonged quasi-lockdowns and they wish to start resuming social and economic activities. However, it is not yet the time for relaxation and there is no room for complacency in epidemic control,\" he said. Surveillance and testing have been ramped up significantly, with more than 700,000 tests conducted since early July, compared to about 350,000 tests from January to June. Hong Kong will expand testing for high-risk and high-exposure target groups, which started in mid-July, he added. These include elderly home employees, taxi and public light bus drivers, restaurant and market stall workers, frontline property management staff members, and foreign domestic helpers staying in boarding facilities. Testing and quarantine arrangements for air and sea crew members have also been tightened.

      " news title: 'Immediate priority' for new environment ministry is a cleaner Singapore amid COVID-19: Grace Fu\n",
      "SINGAPORE: An \"immediate priority\" for the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment will be a cleaner Singapore amid the COVID-19 pandemic, said its minister Grace Fu on Friday (Aug 21). Speaking to reporters at a virtual interview, Ms Fu said that among other things sustainability also involves raising public hygiene standards. Previously Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Ms Fu now helms the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, formerly known as the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources.  \"To me, sustainability is about being leaner, is being stronger, is about being kinder, but most importantly, my immediate priority really is to get Singapore cleaner,\" she told reporters. \"As we're going through COVID, I think it is really a reminder for us that proper hygiene, vector control, clean sanitation, quality water, safer food are all important basic necessities in life that we shouldn't take for granted. And I would like to work on that.\" As such, new legislation in this area will be introduced within three to six months, noted Ms Fu, who took over from Mr Masagos Zulkifli, now Minister for Social and Family Affairs. This includes the amendment of the Environmental Public Health Act, which was announced earlier this year. \"This will allow us to look at the standards of hygiene that we have,\" said Ms Fu. \"We intend to raise (these) standards, particularly in areas where we have more vulnerable users. So we're looking at possibly childcare centres, eldercare facilities … we hope to get something done quite soon.\" A result of this amendment could see managers required to carry out thorough periodic cleaning of their premises at prescribed minimum frequencies, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had said in March. \"The next three months or six months, it's really about getting Singapore cleaner,\" said Ms Fu, but added the longer term goal was about \"sustainability, about environmental protection\". \"RETHINKING\" THE ROLE OF A CLEANER Ms Fu also stressed that there was a need for \"collective responsibility\", as opposed to a reliance on cleaners. \"It's about raising the level of understanding in (the) childcare sector, in the eldercare sector, in the hawker centre sector, so that it's a more collective responsibility - rather than (just) the cleaners - to keep us clean,\" she said. Ms Fu noted that this is not just about cleaning frequency or the number of cleaners available.  Instead, keeping Singapore clean should also be about building \"competencies\" in the kinds of technology, equipment and resources that can be used.  Singapore had in February launched the SG Clean campaign, which the NEA said was aimed at instilling \"a national keep clean culture”. And while there have been similar campaigns in the past, Ms Fu said there were a \"multitude of factors\" behind this particular effort. \"There are (a) multitude of factors as to why we need to mount another campaign, because I think we have tried in the past, but there's no reason why we shouldn't try - particularly now we expect, you know, higher standards of cleanliness.\" Hygiene standards have been raised as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Ms Fu, giving the example of how people now look for washbasins with soap in hawker centres and coffee shops. \"Sometimes operators, if they're too busy, they may overlook simple things like that, or having toilet paper in their toilets,\" she said.  \"So we need to again re-emphasise the importance, and we're looking at how to make that ... legislation change, that can make that a more effective requirement on the facility or the venue owner.\" Ms Fu added that Singaporeans should also look after the interests and health of cleaners, as they are on the frontlines of the pandemic. \"We should look after their interests and their health, because for them to come across soiled tissues and used masks at the hawker centre - it's really not fair to them, that's not a job hazard that they have bargained for,\" said Ms Fu.  \"So I think we would like our users to be more considerate, to be kinder to the cleaners and to exercise individual responsibility to keep the place clean.\" Singaporeans should also not have the mentality that if they clean up after themselves, cleaners will have no jobs to do, added Ms Fu. \"We shouldn't go with the idea that if we clean up ourselves the cleaner is going to go out of a job, that's not the case,\" she said. \"We have a lot of cleaning work that's needed, and we have problems getting more and more cleaners. Because our cleaners are getting on in their age, and we need to rely less on foreign cleaners.\"\n",

      " news title: Man tasered by police arrested after scuffle on Esplanade Drive, 2 officers injured\n",
      "SINGAPORE: A 28-year-old man has been arrested after a scuffle with the police along Esplanade Drive on Friday (Aug 21) that prompted officers to use a taser. A video of the incident, widely circulated online, shows six police officers surrounding a man in the middle of the road. He falls to the ground after a taser was used, staggers to a stationary black car before running across the junction to the other side of the road and tearing off his shirt as police gave chase. In response to CNA's queries, the police said the man has been arrested for disorderly behaviour, voluntarily causing hurt to public servants and for the suspected consumption of controlled drugs.  He is also wanted for an outstanding warrant of arrest, they added. The incident happened at around 10.30am.   The police said they came across a man standing on Esplanade Drive and \"walking about aimlessly and in a dangerous manner\". Officers tried to assist him but he was \"uncooperative and incoherent\", said the police.  \"As officers attempted to engage him further, he started to gesticulate and speak loudly while continuing to walk in the middle of the road, around the junction of Fullerton Road and Esplanade Drive, which was dangerous as there were vehicles driving by,\" said the police.  \"For his safety and the safety of other road users, officers attempted to pull him onto the pavement, but he continued to act violently and resisted the attempts to pull him to safety.\" The police said the man continued to be aggressive and charged towards one of the officers, prompting the use of a taser to try and subdue him. \"However, one of the probes of the taser was later dislodged, limiting its effectiveness,\" said the police. \"As the officers were moving closer to assess the health condition of the man, he got up from the ground and dashed across the road junction.\" The man was eventually subdued when a second round of taser was deployed. According to the police, he assaulted and injured two police officers in the process. \"In considering the use of force, the police take into consideration the proportionality of the force to be applied vis-a-vis the perceived threat, the safety of the target on which force is to be applied, and that of the general public and our officers,\" the police told CNA. \"As far as possible, officers do not want to use so much force as to hurt the target. However, this means that it may not be so easy to subdue him,\" they added. \"It is a difficult balance, but officers have chosen to err on the side of taking consideration of the target’s safety where they can. Police said investigations are ongoing.\n",

Each token is expected to cost about S$10, down from the S$20 in the first batch, with GovTech managing and pacing production of further batches based on demand. \"Drawing from the experience gained in producing the initial batch, GovTech will work with both tenderers to review their designs to further reduce cost, while ensuring effectiveness of the token for contact tracing,\" said GovTech. PCI, which started as a Silicon Valley circuit board manufacturer in 1972, was bought by American private equity firm Platinum Equity for S$265 million last year.  The electronics manufacturer was awarded S$6 million to produce the first batch of 300,000 TraceTogether Tokens.  The tokens were distributed to vulnerable seniors from Jun 28, including those who are physically frail, living alone or have poor family support.  The initial version has an estimated battery life of six to nine months and does not require any charging. It was also designed to be convenient, light and easy to use. Each TraceTogether token will have a unique QR code and is personalised for the recipient's use only. The token works by exchanging Bluetooth signals with other TraceTogether tokens or with mobile phones nearby running the TraceTogether app, with collected data encrypted and kept in the device for no more than 25 days. The token has no GPS, which means it does not capture geolocation data. It also does not have internet or cellular connectivity, so the encrypted data cannot be remotely extracted from the device.

      " news title: Companies seek new opportunities to stay afloat amid COVID-19 pandemic\n",
      "SINGAPORE: After seeing its sales revenue plummet by 40 per cent in 2019 due to protracted international trade tensions, Certact Engineering was bracing for even more pain this year with the COVID-19 pandemic.  But a shift to focus more on the niche segment of plastic engineering has since worked out for the precision engineering firm, with new orders flowing through in recent months. It now expects its annual sales revenue for this year to double from a year ago to about S$8 million.  Certact Engineering made the “risky move” when it was approached by a customer that required plastic parts to produce more DNA sequencing machines, said its managing director Ellis Eng. This was both an opportunity and a challenge for the local firm whose core business lies in producing metal parts for semiconductor manufacturers. While it had plastic engineering as part of its business, it was a “small department” that made up just 10 per cent of sales revenue. “But with our sales coming down, we know that we will face even more challenges if we don’t go into this,” said Ms Eng. The local firm, which was established in 1968, quickly got down to action by redeploying its manpower but the real test came in April when the “circuit breaker” was imposed. “That was when we had to increase production but one of our suppliers handling the secondary process for us was not allowed to operate. So we decided to quickly start our own process and production line.”   With no time to lose, the firm bought new machines and its employees ran trials to work out the new processes, all within a week. “If we lose more time, we will lose the customer,” Ms Eng told CNA. “We have no choice.” Altogether, Certact Engineering invested almost S$150,000 into pivoting its business – a rather “big sum” for a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), it said – but it has paid off.  The company’s ability to invest in new capabilities has instilled confidence in customers, according to Ms Eng. It has since received new contracts from a local developer of X-ray test equipment and another S$2 million order from a company looking to manufacture data storage equipment. “I was very worried initially because of the trade war and then with the pandemic, I thought we will be in deep trouble,” said Ms Eng. Citing a Chinese idiom that meant seeking out opportunities in times of crisis, she added: “COVID-19 was a catalyst to get us to transform and we are glad we did.” Moving forward, Certact Engineering plans to grow its plastic engineering business to account for 60 per cent of sales revenue. RETAIL, TRAVEL FIRMS EXPLORE NEW BUSINESSES Elsewhere in the retail and travel sectors, two companies are also diversifying as the coronavirus outbreak annihilated their industries. With the tourism industry at a standstill, Nam Ho Travel is gearing up to launch virtual tours and an online store for consumers to purchase “trending” snacks and produce from overseas. “As domestic travel is now possible in several countries, we are planning to do livestreams with our overseas presenters visiting hidden gems and … introducing not only the place(s), but also what the viewers can buy there,” said its director Marshall Ooi. “With Singapore’s borders not opening any time soon, we can assist viewers in doing certain purchases.” The online store, Buy Beyond Borders, had a soft launch earlier this month and the final details are being worked on. Meanwhile, Nam Ho’s inbound travel arm, Nam Ho DMC, has turned more than 10 of its mini vans, which used to ferry tourists around Singapore, into school buses and delivery vans since March. It plans to venture deeper into logistics and warehousing services moving forward, said co-founder Mahesh Pawanaskar, noting “huge” longer-term demand in these areas where the company can “integrate both (its) old and new business together”. Mr Pawanaskar added that the firm is in the midst of signing an agreement for a warehouse in Woodlands, and plans to build up a fleet of heavy vehicles by October. These new business plans have since required employees at the travel firm to take on very different tasks. As such, Nam Ho has sent most employees to attend courses, such as the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ), in recent months. “Our drivers went from sending passengers to picking up school children and doing deliveries for logistics and shopping platforms. Our staff, who used to be marketing travel products, are now sourcing for trending items that we can feature on our online platform, helping with packaging and doing deliveries. “Change is not easy but everyone knows we have to do something,” said Mr Ooi, who noted that Nam Ho’s revenue in Singapore has seen “a sharp drop” since the coronavirus outbreak. Previously, its annual revenue in Singapore was more than S$55 million, with equal contribution from inbound and outbound travels. Thus far, the travel firm has invested S$20,000 into purchasing products for its online store. It estimates that its venture into logistics and warehousing will require a heftier investment of more than S$1 million. \"We have applied and will be applying for some grants from both Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Tourism Board in assisting us … on our new business ventures,” said Mr Ooi.  Meanwhile, fashion retailer FJ Benjamin announced its foray into the health and wellness business last week, with an exclusive distributorship agreement with Portugese air purifier maker Airfree. Describing health and wellness as “an industry with long-term growth potential”, the Singapore-listed retail group and luxury brand distributor said it is on the lookout for other brands to broaden its offerings. “While the COVID-19 pandemic has made the move very timely and appropriate given the renewed consumer interest in health and wellness, the diversification is part of a larger strategy we have been working on for some time now to ensure long-term growth outside our core business of fashion retail,” said Group CEO Nash Benjamin. He added that the company decided to partner Airfree as the Portugese manufacturer is a trusted brand with distributions in more than 60 countries. Asked how the company plans to break into the new market, Mr Benjamin referred to the product's unique characteristics, as well as the company's plans to use both online and offline channels including online marketplaces, chain stores such as Mothercare and Motherswork, and other brick-and-mortar channels. POSITION FOR A POST-PANDEMIC WORLD As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreck havoc on economies around the world, including Singapore’s, businesses have been urged to persevere with transformation. Such nimbleness will help when it comes to seizing new opportunities, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his ministerial statement on Monday (Aug 17) where he cited Certact Engineering as an example of a company doing so. In the same speech, where he also announced a further extension of wage subsidies among other support measures, Mr Heng said Singapore has to continue with its economic transformation given how it “will not be business-as-usual” in a post-pandemic world. One expert that CNA spoke with pointed out a pitfall that businesses should take note of when attempting to transform. “Businesses are doing all they can to keep the lights on and to keep employees on the payroll. These are commendable but they also need to ask themselves, will this be a sustainable solution? Can they do it permanently?” said EY’s Asean strategy and transactions leader Vikram Chakravarty. He added that the larger challenge remains for local firms to make an intrinsic shift. “Despite everything, the operating model has not changed and they have not embraced digital for example. Everyone thinks ‘Yes, we are doing something in digital analytics but actually it’s all peripheral stuff.’ Has it fundamentally changed the company is what businesses need to ask themselves.” Mr Tan Chee Wei, KPMG Singapore’s head of consumer tax and retail, said there is urgency for businesses to identify new trends, opportunities and develop the right strategies with the world unlikely to return to pre-COVID-19 days. He added that the extended wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), while helpful for the survival of businesses, may not be sufficient for such transformation in a post-pandemic economy. “A supplementary top-up of SkillsFuture credit would have been a great complement to the JSS extension in reskilling and retraining employees,” Mr Tan added.  The revised JSS will see support extended to wages paid up to next March for most sectors, and up to December this year for sectors which are managing well. The tweaks in wage subsidies are made based on the projected recovery of the different sectors, said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. Precision engineering is among the sectors that will see wage support end in December. For Certact Engineering, any form of support will be useful. While the earlier payouts under JSS helped to alleviate the pressure it had in adjusting its business, it acknowledged that companies “cannot keep depending on the Government”. “If the car engine is dead, you cannot keep pushing the car. You need to change the engine,” said Ms Eng. “We need to sustain through this pandemic by finding ways to transform our business, improve or cut costs. After that, there will be opportunities.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n",

      " news title: Authorities keep ‘close watch’ on suicide rates as experts lay out risk factors for young adults\n",
      "SINGAPORE: People in their 20s are in a transitional phase of their lives – whether it is completing their education, starting their careers or dealing with relationships – and this could result in more stress factors that increase the risk of suicidal thoughts, said authorities and mental health experts. A recent report by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) found that the number of suicides for those in their 20s remained the highest last year among all age groups. In 2019, 71 people aged between 20 and 29 killed themselves, and suicide accounted for about one-third of all reported deaths in this age group. Authorities said they keep a close watch on suicide rates in Singapore, noting the reasons why young adults may be a greater risk. “During the period of youth adulthood from 20 to 29 years, individuals are completing their education, establishing their careers, or starting a family on their own. These transitions through different stages of life can be a time of great stress and flux in a person’s life,” said the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a joint statement in response to CNA's queries. “Without the necessary coping skills and support to navigate crises, failures and setbacks, some may develop feelings of hopelessness and pessimism that can culminate in suicidal attempts.” The SOS statistics are in line with what psychologists have seen. “Individuals in this age group tend to be undergoing multiple life transitions that can bring about associated psychosocial stressors,” said Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist from Inner Light Psychological Services and LP Clinic. “This can lead to an increased risk of developing depression and anxiety, especially within a culture where help-seeking for mental health issues is not common practice.” In response to CNA’s queries, SOS said that common problems cited by people in their 20s were relationship issues, including family, friendships and romantic relationships, as well as difficulties coping with one’s mental health. As those in their 20s are in the midst of developing their sense of identity, their social relationships play “a significant role as a protective factor to how one copes with life’s challenges”, said SOS chief executive Gasper Tan. As such, disputes in these “significant relationships” can be “unsettling”, he added. PEER PRESSURE AND IMPULSE This is also the period where people are starting to become “more independent”, said Mr Tan. “The societal expectations of what success looks like often shapes how an individual measures achievements in various aspects of life such as career progression, educational achievements and romantic relationships,” he said. The belief that they need to be “readily adaptable” and “capable in different areas of responsibility” may instil anxiety or fear in them, he added. “Furthermore, as youths may tie their self-worth according to what may be most prevalent in the life stage they are currently in, failing to attain their desired outcome may aggravate feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness in times of crisis,” said Mr Tan. Young adults might also compare themselves to peers as an “indicator of how well they are doing”, said Dr Lazaroo. “In the last decade, social media has had an influence on how young adults perceive themselves in relation to others. This creates an environment that invites constant comparison with others that may not be necessary or healthy,” she said. Associate Professor Swapna Verma, senior consultant and chief of the department of psychosis at the Institute of Mental Health, added that impulsivity could play a role in suicide attempts. “In young persons, the brain is still developing, and the centres that regulate decision-making and self-control are not fully developed until the age of about 25. Thus, people in this age group tend to be more impulsive compared to other stages of their life,” Assoc Prof Verma said. “The impulsivity, when coupled with the stressors they already face, may make them more likely to act on their suicidal thoughts and contribute to suicidal attempts.” SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE MSF, MOH and MOE said they keep a “close watch” on suicide rates in Singapore, and implement various programmes to address mental well-being among young people.  Noting that the underlying causes of suicide are complex, the ministries said they take a “multi-pronged approach” which includes building resilience, reducing stigma, as well as identifying and supporting those at risk of suicide. In mainstream schools, the Character and Citizenship Education lessons will be revised next year to spotlight mental health education. Students will be taught how to recognise common mental health issues and symptoms and know when and how to seek help. “Similarly, the IHLs (institutes of higher learning) have curricular and co-curricular mental wellness programmes and activities for students, which incorporate mental wellness literacy or awareness talks and workshops,” said the ministries. “Most mainstream schools and IHLs also have peer support efforts to encourage students to look out for one another, and encourage a peer in distress to seek help from trusted adults, parents, teachers or counsellors. We are on track to have a peer support structure and culture in place in all schools by 2022.” The ministries added that they also work with various government agencies and community partners. One initiative is the Youth Mental Well-being Network formed in February, supported by MOH, MOE and MSF, to build on the work of agencies and ground-up community groups to “strengthen our ecosystem of support”, said the ministries. This is on top of efforts by social service agencies like the Singapore Association for Mental Health, TOUCH Community Services and Fei Yue Community Services which offer helplines and counselling to support those in need. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) has other initiatives including the Beyond the Label Movement in 2018 to address stigma towards those with mental health conditions, as well as the Youth Alliance in September 2019 to support young people and encourage them to seek help. NCSS also launched an interactive helpbot called Belle through Facebook messenger and iMessage, which provides 24/7 access to information about helplines and mental health services for users of all ages. “Raising awareness and reducing the stigma of mental health issues are critical to encourage and normalise help-seeking behaviour,” said the ministries. “Early detection and intervention are key, and people struggling with emotional problems, mental health issues or suicidal thoughts should be encouraged to seek help.” Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg. If someone you know is at immediate risk, call 24-hour emergency medical services.\n",

      " news title: Hong Kong court blocks release of first person charged under new security law\n",
      "HONG KONG: In a landmark decision, a Hong Kong court denied on Friday (Aug 21) a bid for the release of the first person charged with inciting separatism and terrorism under a new national security law in the city. Police said Tong Ying-kit, 23, carried a sign reading \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\", and drove his motorbike into officers, knocking down several on a narrow street, before falling over and getting arrested. The government of the Asian financial hub has said the protest slogan connotes separatism or subversion under the new law, stoking concern over freedom of expression in the former British colony. Two judges of Hong Kong's High Court rejected Tong's application for release from detention, and set Tuesday for a bail hearing. \"The applicant's application for a writ of habeas corpus is dismissed,\" judges Anderson Chow and Alex Lee said in the ruling, adding that Tong should have instead sought review of an order that denied him bail. Tong was denied bail last month, with the case adjourned to Oct 6, as prosecutors sought more time to collect evidence. He was among more than 300 demonstrators against the new law who were arrested by police on Jul 1, less than 24 hours after it was unveiled and took effect. Hong Kong's common law has traditionally allowed defendants to seek release unless prosecutors can show lawful grounds for their detention. But the burden is now placed on the defendant, under the new law drafted by Beijing, which is not a common law jurisdiction and where the judiciary is controlled by the Communist Party. Article 42 says, \"No bail shall be granted to a criminal suspect or defendant unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing that the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.\" The national security law has drawn wide criticism in the West for jeopardising basic rights and freedoms the global financial hub was promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Supporters of the law, which provides for jail terms of up to life for anything China considers to be secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces, say it would bring stability after a year of unrest.\n",

      " news title: Former fishball noodle seller gets jail for splashing hot water at prawn noodle hawker, disfiguring her chest\n",
      "SINGAPORE: In the heat of an argument, a fishball noodle hawker scooped hot water from a tank on the stove and splashed it three times at a hawker from a prawn noodle stall, disfiguring her chest.   Former Whampoa Market hawker Kim Eng Suthivanich, 52, was sentenced on Friday (Aug 21) to 10 months' jail for one count of voluntarily causing hurt by means of a heated substance. She was also ordered to pay a compensation order of S$225.93 to the victim. Eng had been acquitted of the charge, but was freshly convicted in June after the prosecution appealed. The incident took place on Aug 13, 2017, at Whampoa Market. Eng had been working at the fishball noodle stall for about seven months before this. The victim, 46, owned a prawn noodles stall at the same market.  The victim knew Eng's boss and had his permission to borrow items such as condiments, as well as to use the fridge at the fishball noodle stall. Eng also knew about these arrangements. On the morning of the incident, an argument broke out between them after the victim did not manage to retrieve her ingredients from the fishball noodle stall.  Eng told the victim that she dislikes her, claiming that she did not return some items.  Denying this, the victim replied that everything in the stall belongs to Eng's boss, and that this was a matter between her and the boss. Angered, Eng told the victim to get out, but the victim insisted on retrieving her items. Eng pushed her backwards at least twice, before threatening her in Mandarin: \"Do you believe that I will use hot water to splash on you?\" Eng then grabbed a ladle, scooped hot water and splashed it at the victim. She did this at least three times, continuing to do so as the victim fled.  The victim suffered first-degree burns on her upper chest, loin and arm and second-degree burns on her left breast. Her chest was permanently disfigured. The episode was caught on closed-circuit television footage, but Eng claimed trial and was initially acquitted after a lower court judge found that Eng did not intend or know that splashing water would likely cause hurt to the victim. The prosecution appealed against this and a high court judge reversed the acquittal in June. Eng no longer works at the fishball noodle stall. PROSECUTORS ASK FOR A YEAR'S JAIL, DEFENCE ASK FOR A MONTH Deputy Public Prosecutors Bhajanvir Singh and Delicia Tan called for a year's jail, saying that Eng had committed the offence over \"a senseless argument\", causing serious injuries that inflicted serious psychological and emotional trauma on the victim. \"It is jarring that up till today, (Eng) has not known an ounce of remorse. She took absolutely no responsibility for her actions and blatantly blamed the victim for causing the injuries to herself,\" said Ms Tan. The victim's injuries have caused her to \"lose self-confidence and affected her ability to start a relationship with another person for fear that her partner will eventually leave her as her body is 'incomplete' due to her disfigured breast\", the prosecutors said. \"As a result of the above, she has resigned herself to the possibility of being single for the rest of her life,\" they added, citing a plastic surgeon who stated \"no surgery\" can repair the damage. Eng's \"brutish\" behaviour was \"brazenly committed in public, at a hawker centre, close to lunch time\", said the prosecutors. Defence lawyers Tang Shang Wei and Vincent Ho from WongPartnership asked for not more than a month's jail, saying that their client had been \"provoked\" by the victim who was \"the aggressor at all times\", and that the incident was in the spur of the moment. This is also Eng's first brush with the law, and she has \"already endured significant hardship throughout the course of the proceedings and has limited financial means\", said Mr Tang. They objected to the prosecution's description of Eng as unremorseful, pointing to Eng's police statement which stated she was \"apologetic\" for her actions and will not do it again. Eng has to work to support her family and elderly mother, after her husband abandoned her and their two young children, added the defence.  For voluntarily causing hurt by a heated substance, she could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.\n",

      "SINGAPORE: A 28-year-old man has been arrested after a scuffle with the police along Esplanade Drive on Friday (Aug 21) that prompted officers to use a taser. A video of the incident, widely circulated online, shows six police officers surrounding a man in the middle of the road. He falls to the ground after a taser was used, staggers to a stationary black car before running across the junction to the other side of the road and tearing off his shirt as police gave chase. In response to CNA's queries, the police said the man has been arrested for disorderly behaviour, voluntarily causing hurt to public servants and for the suspected consumption of controlled drugs.  He is also wanted for an outstanding warrant of arrest, they added. The incident happened at around 10.30am.   The police said they came across a man standing on Esplanade Drive and \"walking about aimlessly and in a dangerous manner\". Officers tried to assist him but he was \"uncooperative and incoherent\", said the police.  \"As officers attempted to engage him further, he started to gesticulate and speak loudly while continuing to walk in the middle of the road, around the junction of Fullerton Road and Esplanade Drive, which was dangerous as there were vehicles driving by,\" said the police.  \"For his safety and the safety of other road users, officers attempted to pull him onto the pavement, but he continued to act violently and resisted the attempts to pull him to safety.\" The police said the man continued to be aggressive and charged towards one of the officers, prompting the use of a taser to try and subdue him. \"However, one of the probes of the taser was later dislodged, limiting its effectiveness,\" said the police. \"As the officers were moving closer to assess the health condition of the man, he got up from the ground and dashed across the road junction.\" The man was eventually subdued when a second round of taser was deployed. According to the police, he assaulted and injured two police officers in the process. \"In considering the use of force, the police take into consideration the proportionality of the force to be applied vis-a-vis the perceived threat, the safety of the target on which force is to be applied, and that of the general public and our officers,\" the police told CNA. \"As far as possible, officers do not want to use so much force as to hurt the target. However, this means that it may not be so easy to subdue him,\" they added. \"It is a difficult balance, but officers have chosen to err on the side of taking consideration of the target’s safety where they can. Police said investigations are ongoing.\n",

      " news title: Turkey's Erdogan converts another former church into mosque\n",
      "ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday (Aug 21) ordered another ancient Orthodox church that became a mosque and then a popular Istanbul museum to be turned back into a place of Muslim worship. The decision to transform the Kariye Museum into a mosque came just a month after a similarly controversial conversion for the UNESCO World Heritage-recognised Hagia Sophia. Both changes reflect Erdogan's efforts to galvanise his more conservative and nationalist supporters at a time when Turkey is suffering a new spell of inflation and economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus. But they have added to Turkey's tensions with Greece and its Orthodox Church. The Greek foreign ministry called the decision \"yet another provocation against religious persons everywhere\" by the Turkish government. \"STEEPED IN HISTORY\" The 1,000-year-old building's history closely mirrors that of the Hagia Sophia - its bigger neighbour on the historic western bank of the Golden Horn estuary on the European side of Istanbul. The Holy Saviour in Chora was a medieval Byzantine church decorated with 14th-century frescoes of the Last Judgement that remain treasured in the Christian world. It was originally converted into the Kariye Mosque half a century after the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks. It became the Kariye Museum after World War II as Turkey pushed ahead with the creation of a more secular new republic out of the ashes of the Ottoman Empire. A group of American art historians then helped restore the original church's mosaics and opened them up for public display in 1958. But Erdogan is placing an ever greater political emphasis on the battles that resulted in the defeat of Byzantium by the Ottomans. Turkey's top administrative court approved the museum's conversion into a mosque in November. \"It's a place steeped in history which holds a lot of symbolism for a lot of different people,\" said 48-year-old French tourist Frederic Sicard outside the building. \"For me, (these conversions) are a little difficult to understand and to follow. But we would visit if it were a mosque. We might just have to arrange visits around prayer times.\" \"TOLERANCE\" The sandy-coloured structure visible today replaced one created as a part of a monastery in the fourth century when Constantinople was the new capital of the Roman Empire. It features a minaret in one corner and small cascading domes similar to those of other grand mosques whose calls to prayer echo over Istanbul.   But inside it is filled with magnificent frescoes and mosaics that represent some of the finest examples of Byzantine art in the Christian world. Turkey's tumultuous efforts to reconcile these two histories form the underpinnings of the country's contemporary politics and social life. Opposition HDP party lawmaker Garo Paylan called the transformation \"a shame for our country\". \"One of the symbols of our country's deep, multicultural identity and multi-religious history has been sacrified,\" he said in a tweet. Yet some locals fully supported the change. \"There are dozens, hundreds of churches, synagogues in Istanbul and only a few of them have been opened to prayer as mosques,\" said Yucel Sahin as he strolled by the building after the morning rain. \"There is a lot of tolerance in our culture.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON: US lawmakers will aggressively question US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in his first appearance before Congress on Friday (Aug 21) about recent cost-cutting measures that Democrats say appeared to be an attempt to boost President Donald Trump's re-election chances. Under pressure from the public and lawmakers, DeJoy on Tuesday suspended all mail service changes until after the Nov 3 election. Critics feared they would interfere with mail-in balloting, which is expected to be much more widely used amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has repeatedly and without evidence said that an increase in mail-in ballots would lead to a surge in fraud, although Americans have long voted by mail. The Republican chairman of the Senate committee holding Friday's hearing, Ron Johnson, will defend DeJoy in his opening statement, citing his \"commendable attempt to reduce those excess costs that are now being cynically used to create this false political narrative\". Democrats will want to know whether DeJoy plans to undo changes to the mail made in recent weeks. Changes that threatened to slow mail delivery - and in some cases, already have - include reductions in overtime, restrictions on extra mail transportation trips, and new mail-sorting and delivery policies, enacted in an attempt to cut costs. DeJoy, who has also agreed to testify before the Democratic-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Monday, will testify before the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Friday. While criticism from Democrats is expected, any signs that Republican senators are unhappy with DeJoy's cost-cutting efforts could suggest his tenure as postmaster general is at risk. DeJoy, a major political donor and ally of Trump, assumed the job in June. A group of 90 Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday called on the Postal Service's board of governors to immediately remove DeJoy \"to protect this critical institution,\" according to a letter sent to board members. The House is set to vote on a bill on Saturday that would provide US$25 billion in funding for the Postal Service and require the reversal of operational changes.\n",

      "FRANKFURT: German utility RWE  wants compensation from the government for phasing out coal power generation to be paid out as quickly as possible, it said on Friday. \"RWE wants to ensure that the contract negotiated with the government can be signed immediately because first power plant closures are to take place at RWE as early as the end of the year, unlike at other operators,\" a company spokeswoman said. Germany's lower house of parliament is expected to approve the relevant bill next month. The bill pledges to pay out 50 billion euros (US$59 billion) to help mining companies, power plant operators and affected regions cope with Germany's transition to more renewable energy. The country has committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55per cent by 2030 from 1990 levels. RWE is due to receive 2.6 billion euros for the phased closure of its brown coal mines and power stations. Earlier, the Spiegel magazine's online edition reported RWE wanted to revisit the deal to start receiving the funds as Czech peer Leag continued to question the package. However, the spokeswoman said RWE was fully behind the deal. A spokesman for Leag, which is part of the EPH group, declined to comment on whether it was seeking changes to the coal exit bill. While phasing out coal generation, RWE is expanding in renewable power where it became Europe's third-largest player after an asset swap deal with rival E.ON .

      "SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) have welcomed the Government's decision on Friday (Aug 21) to ease restrictions on inbound travel from Brunei and New Zealand.  From Sep 1, some travellers coming to Singapore from those two countries will not be required to serve a stay-home notice but will instead take a COVID-19 test upon arrival. \"The recovery of air travel and airfreight is a necessary catalyst for the recovery of global trade and economies severely impacted by COVID-19,\" said SIA Group. \"Today’s announcement is an important step towards the gradual rebuilding of the Singapore air hub. The SIA Group will continue to work closely with the Singapore government and all stakeholders to support this.\" SIA, SilkAir and Scoot accounted for more than half of the passengers flying in and out of Changi Airport in the last financial year. With the easing of restrictions, SIA Group said it will work closely with the authorities to safeguard the health and safety of its customers, employees and communities it operates in. CAG said it looks forward to welcoming tourists and leisure visitors to Singapore again. \"CAG welcomes today’s announcement on the opening of inbound leisure travel from New Zealand and Brunei,\" said spokesman Ivan Tan. \"This is indeed good news for Changi Airport, and it is an encouraging start to what we hope will be a gradual resumption of air travel to and from Singapore,\" he added. \"The health and safety of staff and visitors at Changi Airport remain a priority for us. We will work closely with the various government agencies and our airport partners to facilitate the safe travel processes at Changi when we receive visitors from these two countries.\" The COVID-19 pandemic has battered the aviation and travel industry worldwide. In July, SIA Group reported a S$1.12 billion net loss in the first quarter after drastically cutting capacity due to travel restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Figures released on Monday showed that three of the group's carriers continue to see sharp declines in passenger traffic for July.  \"The SIA Group will continue to closely monitor the demand for international air travel, and be nimble and flexible in adjusting our capacity to match this,\" it said on Friday. Singapore will also update its travel advisory for people who want to visit Brunei and New Zealand - to allow general travel to the two countries. However, they should check the entry requirements imposed by the respective governments. Under Singapore's current advisory, residents are advised to defer all travel abroad, except for essential business and official travel under green-lane and fast-lane arrangements.  Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n",

      "REUTERS: Shares of Pfizer Inc and U.S.-listed shares of partner BioNTech SE rose on Friday after they released additional data for their experimental coronavirus vaccine and reiterated they were on track to seek a regulatory review in October. Pfizer has said repeatedly since June that it was targeting October for its application and the companies started a large late-stage study last month of the candidate vaccine, one of the few globally in later stages of development. On Thursday they reported data from previous early-stage trials of the vaccine, BNT162b2, that showed it induced similar immune responses and had milder side effects than prior data on another candidate. Pfizer stock, down 1per cent this year, has trailed the stellar rises in value of major pharmaceutical companies this year. Moderna and Britain's AstraZeneca are among those to have moved into late-stage trials. Raymond James European Strategist Chris Bailey said the Pfizer/BioNTech release had contributed to a more optimistic mood on stock markets on Friday.

      "REUTERS: The Belarusian football federation (ABFF) said that the next round of matches in the top three divisions as well as the women's championship will be played behind closed doors because of the mass demonstrations around the country. President Alexander Lukashenko, facing the biggest crisis of his 26 year rule, was declared the winner of an Aug. 9 presidential election, but tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets saying the election is rigged. Lukashenko, a gruff former collective farm boss, has blamed foreign countries for stirring unrest and funding protesters. At least two demonstrators have died and thousands have been jailed, many emerging to complain of beatings and abuse. Soccer club BATE Borisov's player Anton Soroca and Ilya Litvinov of ice hockey team Dinamo Molodechno were among those arrested, causing public outrage. \"The ABFF informs that in connection with the current situation, the ABFF's Bureau of the Executive Committee decided to hold next round's matches without the presence of spectators at the stadium,\" ABFF said in a statement. CSKA Moscow's Belarusian striker Ilya Shkurin has said he won't play for his country until Lukashenko steps down. CSKA's Belarusian coach, Viktor Goncharenko, was among hundreds of top athletes and coaches who also strongly criticised his government for police violence against peaceful protesters. Belarus was the only country in Europe playing soccer in front of fans amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Lukashenko has been publicly sceptical about the need for strong action to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. He has called fears over the virus a \"psychosis\" and variously suggested drinking vodka, visiting saunas or playing ice hockey to beat the disease.

      " news title: Stick or twist? Flick faces final tactical dilemma\n",
      "LISBON: Bayern Munich's success in reaching the final of the Champions League has been built on a very distinct tactical approach but it is one that carries big risks against Paris St Germain, leaving coach Hansi Flick with a major dilemma. Bayern play an aggressive pressing game, pinning back their opponents, maintaining pressure on their defence and making it difficult for them to move the ball through the midfield. It is an approach that has worked superbly in the knockout games in the Portuguese capital with Barcelona simply swept aside in an astonishing 8-2 victory for the Germans and then Olympique Lyonnais succumbing 3-0 in the semi-finals. In 2020, not one team has managed to beat Bayern, with only RB Leipzig managing a draw back in February. In addition to their dominance domestically, Flick's side have won every game in the Champions League this season. The Bayern approach shows the increasing irrelevance of describing tactical approaches via numerical formations - after all, Robert Lewandowski is their only striker but he is far from alone. The Pole leads the line but the press comes from a trio behind him - Serge Gnabry on the right, Thomas Mueller centrally and Ivan Perisic on the left. Leon Goretzka and Thiago Alcantara are hardly typical 'holding midfielders' with Goretzka in particular helping pin-back opposition defences. Crucially, the two full backs get into advanced positions, creating the 'swarming effect' that so many teams cannot cope with. Alphonso Davies on the left, is the epitome of the modern, attacking full back, while Joshua Kimmich, who has deputised for the injured Benjamin Pavard, is a midfield player by nature. The only problem with this approach is that it only works if Bayern's defence plays a very high-line and compresses the game. That carries with it the risk of opposition attacks with pace getting behind the back of Bayern's defence with long balls forward or swift, well-constructed counter-attacks. Lyon managed to do just that on Wednesday but lacked the clinical finishing to make the most of the opportunities that came their way. PSG's attack, with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, is unlikely to be so forgiving. Mbappe, in particular, presents a real problem given his lightning speed from the left flank. Neymar's ability to make runs from deeper positions and Angel Di Maria's ability to pick them out with the perfect pass mean Bayern's back line will be tested on Sunday. In particular Davies and Kimmich or Frenchman Pavard, if he is chosen after coming back from injury, will have to be as accomplished defensively as they have been with the ball. Flick could reduce the danger of Mbappe by springing Bayern's offside trap, ordering his defence to play deeper, reducing the space able to be exploited behind them. But that would stretch the game and work contrary to Bayern's game-plan in the opposition's half. It is a classic case of stick or twist? The good news for those hoping for an exciting game is that, so far, Flick has shown no inclination to alter his approach. (Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Christian Radnedge)\n",

      "More than a month after she was shot in the feet after a party in the Hollywood Hills, Megan Thee Stallion said for the first time Thursday night (Aug 20) that fellow hip-hop star Tory Lanez was the person who pulled the trigger. \"Yes ... Tory shot me. You shot me and you got your publicist and people to these blogs lying,\" the 25-year-old rapper, whose legal name is Megan Pete, said angrily in an Instagram Live video. \"Stop lying!\" Representatives for Lanez, a 28-year-old rapper and singer whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, did not respond to requests for comment late Thursday night, and have not responded to several requests for comment from The Associated Press.  Pete said she did not tell Los Angeles police who came to the scene on Jul 12 about the shooting because she was afraid of the legal repercussions and afraid for her safety.  \"I didn't tell the police nothing because I didn't want us to get in no more trouble,\" she says in the video. Peterson was arrested the morning of the incident on suspicion of possession of a concealed weapon and was released on bail later that day, but has not been charged with that or anything related from the evening. Police and prosecutors say the case remains under investigation.  Pete, Peterson and others were sharing an SUV after the party in the early hours of Jul 12. She said in the video that there was an argument between the people in the vehicle, and Peterson shot her when she tried to walk away. She denied rumours that she had hit him in the SUV.  Pete first said publicly that she was shot later that week, and revealed more incrementally in several social media posts since it happened, usually in response to what she said were false stories spreading.  She said from the beginning that she expected to fully recover, but said in subsequent posts that the shooting, which required her to have surgery to have the bullets removed, was \" super scary \" and \"the worst experience of my life,\" and she felt blessed that the gunfire hit where it did. She consistently declined to name Peterson until Thursday night, when she also tweeted, \"Lie one more time and ima quit sparing you.\"  Megan Thee Stallion was already a major hip-hop star after a triumphant year that recently saw her nominated for artist of the year at the upcoming MTV Video Music Awards, and in recent days has become part of a huge cultural phenomenon with her guest stint on the Cardi B song WAP. The bawdy celebration of women's sexuality entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No 1 this week.  (Source: CNA/AP)\n",

      " news title: Actress Lori Loughlin, husband await prison fate in college admissions scandal\n",
      "Since Full House star Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were arrested last year on charges that they bribed their daughters' way into college, the famous couple has been consistent about at least one thing: their silence.  Loughlin, who gained fame for her role as the wholesome Aunt Becky in the sitcom that ran from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, and Giannulli have not made any public statements since they were charged with paying half a million dollars to get their daughters into the University of Southern California – or surprisingly decided to plead guilty despite their lawyers' repeated claims that they were innocent.  And unlike every other prominent parent who has been sentenced so far in the college admissions cheating scheme, the couple has not submitted letters expressing regret or notes of support from family and friends to the judge who will decide their fate on Friday – a move lawyers describe as puzzling.  \"I don't know why you wouldn't want to at least submit something to ensure that this goes the way you want it to,\" said Matthew Galluzzo, a criminal defense attorney in New York who's not involved in the case. \"Why not some letters of support from family? Why not a letter from them with some remorse or whatever to make sure it goes through?\" Sean Berkowitz, a former federal prosecutor leading their high-profile defense team, declined to comment this week.  Loughlin and Giannulli will have a chance to address US District Judge Nathaniel Gorton when he decides whether to accept their unusual plea deals with prosecutors, which calls for Loughlin to serve two months in prison and Giannulli to serve five months. Under the plea deal, Giannulli has also agreed to pay a US$250,000 (S$340,000) fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Loughlin's agreement calls for her to pay a US$150,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service.  Unlike most plea agreements, in which the judge remains free to decide the defendant's sentence, Loughlin and Giannulli's proposed prison terms are binding if the judge accepts the deals.  Loughlin and Giannulli will appear before the Boston federal court judge during separate sentencing hearings held via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic.  The couple's silence stands in stark contrast to other parents who've admitted to charges in the so-called \"Operation Varsity Blues\" case, including fellow actress Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced to two weeks behind bars for paying US$15,000 to rig her daughter's entrance exam score.  When Huffman agreed to plead guilty less than a month after her arrest, she released a statement accepting full responsibility and expressing \"deep regret and shame.\" She showed up for her court appearances stone-faced, clutching the hand of her brother.  Before she was sentenced, Huffman filed a lengthy letter to the judge describing how she \"deceived the educational community,\" \"betrayed\" her daughter and \"failed\" her family. Her husband, actor William H Macy, and her Desperate Housewives co-star Eva Longoria also wrote letters to the judge showing support and detailing the impact the charges had on her life. Loughlin and Giannulli have taken a decidedly different path. In her first appearance in Boston after her arrest, Loughlin smiled for the cameras, waved at fans outside the courthouse and shook hands with prosecutors inside.  She and Giannulli fiercely fought the allegations for months, with their lawyers accusing prosecutors of withholding evidence that would exonerate them. Their decision to plead guilty to paying US$500,000 to get their daughters admitted to USC as crew recruits – even though neither girl was a rower – came shortly after the judge rejected their bid to dismiss the case. At their plea hearing, they made no comments other than to answer questions from the judge.  Prosecutors filed a memo on Monday (Aug 17) urging the judge to accept the deals, calling Giannulli \"the more active participant in the scheme,\" while they said Loughlin \"took a less active role, but was nonetheless fully complicit.\" The defence almost always also files its own memo ahead of sentencing to push for a favourable outcome, but Loughlin and Giannulli's lawyers haven't.  Experts say the couple may feel doing so would just attract more negative media attention and isn't worth it since there is no disagreement between prosecutors and the defence on the appropriate sentence. They may also be concerned that saying the wrong thing could blow up their deal with prosecutors, lawyers say.  With her fame, Loughlin may just not want to make public the intimate details of her life that letters of support often go into, said Brad Bailey, a Boston criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor. Just about any experienced lawyer would want to file a sentencing memo or letters of support to avoid any risk of the judge rejecting the deal, he said.  \"My guess is this is probably being done at the instruction of the defendants and against the inclination of their attorneys,\" Bailey said.  (Source: CNA/AP)\n",

      " news title: When can you get a COVID-19 vaccine? Five things you should know\n",
      "SINGAPORE: Massive efforts are underway to develop a vaccine strong enough to fight and eliminate the novel coronavirus. Latest reports indicate that at least 165 vaccine candidates are being developed across the world, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, India, China and Singapore. Nearly 30 projects are already in various phases of human trials, including one jointly developed by Duke-NUS Medical School and US pharmaceutical company Arcturus Therapeutics. But developing a vaccine is no easy task. What usually takes 10 to 15 years, researchers are now accelerating so that a vaccine could be ready for emergency use by next year. With the process on the fast track, the hope of a vaccine comes with vital questions. And here are some answers from the experts.   1. IS A VACCINE BY 2021 REALLY POSSIBLE? Six of the vaccine candidates are now in the third stage of testing, and they “look potentially interesting”, Dr Jerome Kim, the director general of the International Vaccine Institute, said on the programme In Conversation. (Watch the episode here.) “They make the right protective responses. They all protect monkeys against infection ... So there’s a lot of suggestive evidence that they might protect for at least a short period of time. We don’t really know, though,” he said. “We have to be very careful when we use animal studies ... So now it’s (about) making sure that we can show that it actually prevents infection in humans.” He cited the potential of the vaccine candidate from the University of Oxford and drug giant AstraZeneca as an example. Recent results of a study, involving more than 1,000 human volunteers, showed that the vaccine generated a strong immune response.   The reason this could be done at “remarkable” speed, said Professor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of Duke-NUS Medical School’s Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme, is that the research groups concerned have worked on other viruses before. The Oxford group has done “a lot of work” on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, on Ebola and on Chikungunya, he noted on the programme Insight. (Watch the episode here.) “So how they got this (vaccine) very rapidly into humans is they went to the regulator and said, ‘Look at our past record.’” Mr Sudarshan Jain, the secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, acknowledged that the virus behind COVID-19 is “very cunning” and “unpredictable”, which drug makers “don’t understand fully” yet. But as the “entire pharmaceutical industry has taken up the challenge”, he said on In Conversation, “there’s a possibility” of four or five vaccines. “I’m hopeful that we should be able to reach that position towards next year.” (Watch the episode here.) Dr Kim thinks it is possible: “If everything works as it should, by the end of the year, we may have a readout on at least one of the vaccines currently in the pipeline — that it may protect or may not protect populations.” 2. HOW SAFE WILL IT BE? The bigger question, Dr Kim noted, is whether there will be “enough safety data”, as the final phase of human testing in the “normal development cycle” of a vaccine is five to 10 years, instead of six months. WATCH: Is a safe COVID-19 vaccine by 2021 really possible? (6:05)  The “thousands” of safety evaluations to be done this year will be a “good amount”, although he acknowledged: “We aren’t really going to be able to tell. “In the short term, to the point where the vaccine will either be given in emergency-use authorisation or an approval for market, we’d have less long-term safety information than we normally have.” So vaccine developers should “follow the people who receive the vaccine and placebo for a much longer time than we normally do”, he said, suggesting “two or three years or longer”. This is to ensure that there are no side effects “at a very low level that we should be aware of, but that we can’t because we’re pushing hard to show that the vaccine works”. Prof Ooi stressed: “Between being the first (to develop a vaccine) and getting it right, it’s more important to get it right.” But he does not see speed and safety as “mutually exclusive”, and thinks “we can shrink the timeline” for vaccine and drug development in general, which has been lengthened as more studies were added over the decades.   “The important thing is the body of evidence that guides the development,” he said. “If the evidence is strong ... then you can move very, very fast because you know what to look for ... and (have) the confidence that what we're doing is going to be safe.” 3. WILL COUNTRIES HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE VACCINE? Much is at stake in the COVID-19 vaccine race, although it has to do not only with science, but also politics. The current US administration has already been accused of trying to monopolise first rights to vaccines being developed by a company in Germany and one in France — alleged attempts that the two European governments made sure to block.   The reason for self-interest is evident, noted Prof Ooi. Countries that vaccinate first will “get out of all the lockdowns” and restrictions, return to normal economic activity and recover “much faster” than those without access to the vaccine. There are “bound to be” politics involved, said Mr Jain. “Perhaps ... in the country where the vaccine development has taken place, the citizens of that country will demand that, first, the vaccine should be available in (their) country.” But with the vaccine development taking place across the world, he reiterated his belief that a handful of vaccines will emerge, which will “ensure” supply. There is also “a lot of discussion” about avoiding vaccine hoarding, he cited. “The dialogue will help us to ensure equitable distribution. It may not be 100 per cent perfect, but there’s a lot of consciousness,” he added. “At the end of the day, we’d like to find a level playing field.” In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to making a Chinese vaccine available to all. But the question here, said Prof Joseph Liow, the dean of Nanyang Technological University’s College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, is whether Beijing can win other countries’ trust and show that it is extending this help “in good faith” and with “no strings attached”. WATCH: US-China rivalry politicises the COVID-19 vaccine race (5:00)  Even if governments map out a plan to “guarantee” vaccines for “a certain percentage of their need first”, said Dr Kim, “it may not be that much”. “I mean, who are the people in greatest need? It may be the elderly, healthcare workers or people with underlying conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe disease or death. “Maybe that’s 20 per cent of the population. So you don’t need all of the vaccine all at once. You may want to just vaccinate the most vulnerable people first.” 4. SO HOW SOON CAN EVERYONE GET VACCINATED? As someone with no comorbidities, or underlying diseases, Mr Jain does not expect to be a candidate for immunisation before the end of next year. That means vaccination for everyone only by 2022.   “Even if we do the best (to ramp up production), I don’t think we can see anything earlier,” he said. “The capacity at the moment is limited ... It’ll take time for production and distribution (to be ramped up).” Dr Kim noted that the US government is asking companies to start the manufacturing, seemingly “placing very educated bets on certain vaccines” and de-risking the projects by giving the companies funding — which he hopes will also “enable the companies to offer the vaccine at a lower cost”. Organisations like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations are doing the same, including trying to secure manufacturing facilities down to the glass vials for the vaccines. The coalition has identified the need to have vaccine capacity for 10 billion doses. “There is a manufacturing capacity out there. And the real question will be how quickly can we mobilise it,” said Dr Kim. “Countries and companies are already making contracts with different organisations (and) manufacturers to be able to ensure that the vaccine is made ... (but) we’ve never undertaken something like this before.” If 60 to 70 per cent of people need to be vaccinated to achieve “herd immunity”, that may mean “vaccinating in the order of four billion to six billion people”.   “If there are two doses (per vaccination), that’s eight billion to 12 billion doses of vaccine. That’s a huge number,” he said, adding that getting up to those numbers over the next 12 months “would be a stretch”. 5. WILL A VACCINE MEAN A RETURN TO NORMAL? All things considered, Mr Jain doubts that life will return to normal in the first year of discovering a vaccine. “Hence it’s very important that all of us have to be cautious. All of us have to wear masks ... behave with social distancing, and then the whole process will evolve over a period of time,” he said. Most experts agree that a vaccine will not get rid of the coronavirus. “Too many people are now infected with Sars-CoV-2 that it won’t disappear,” said Prof Ooi.   Citing another reason the coronavirus is here to stay, he added: “It came from an animal, and we can’t vaccinate all the animals, especially the wild animals. “So we’ll have this virus, and occasionally it’ll spill over and cause outbreaks, especially when vaccination rates are low. And that would be the challenge.” People may have to also accept that the first vaccine put into use “might not even be able to prevent infection”, said Prof Jin Dong-Yan from the University of Hong Kong's School of Biomedical Sciences. “But if it could prevent severe disease and ... not have a major adverse effect, that’s already good enough,” he told Insight. Virology professor Ian Jones from the University of Reading in the UK noted that the data released so far indicates that the experimental vaccines protect against COVID-19 but may not give the “sterilising immunity” to stop an infection altogether. “The problem with that would be that someone who’s vaccinated could still be infected and could then spread the virus, so it’s not the perfect solution,” he told Insight. Even so, he views the development of a vaccine as “the most useful way forward”.   “What we're aiming for is a vaccine that takes away the fear of the disease,” he said. “If you get vaccinated, and you’re pretty confident that you're not going to die, then I don't think people will worry too much.” And of all the solutions to the pandemic, a vaccine is “probably the most cost-effective”, believes Dr Kim. “A vaccine is the one potential intervention that’ll get us back to something similar to what we had before,” he said. How similar will depend “a little bit on the qualities of the vaccine” and also on “several of the unknown things about the virus and viral infection in the population”. “We’ve learned a tremendous amount in six and a half months, but it’s not enough,” he noted. Assuming vaccination rates are at 60 to 70 per cent five years from now, however, then he would say “we’ve protected the population from the consequences of an outbreak”. “You’ll see an occasional COVID-19 infection that’ll look like someone has a fever and maybe some cough or shortness of breath. You’ll test them, and you’ll find COVID. But it won’t spread in the population because enough people are immune.” For now, the “bread and butter” is safe distancing, a high level of hygiene “and all that”, said Prof Ooi. “Then you overlay that (with) vaccines and drugs. Then we have a chance of really overcoming this virus.” The programme Insight airs on Thursdays at 9pm, and In Conversation airs every Wednesday at 9pm.\n",

      "SINGAPORE: In the midst of the financial crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a silver lining for home owners. Across the world, central banks like the United States’ Federal Reserve have slashed interest rates to boost economic growth, owing to uncertainty over the situation. In Singapore, there has also been a decline in the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor), which historically tracks US Fed rates. This means banks here have reduced some of their home loan interest rates — good news for property owners with mortgages to pay.   For example, banking professional Richard Yeong, 39, bought his first home in 2016 and has since switched to a cheaper loan package twice, saving him thousands of dollars. With global interest rates likely to stay low for longer, this is an ideal time for home owners to either reprice or refinance their mortgage. But which is better? The programme Money Mind has a guide to what they should consider before they switch their home loan packages. (Watch the episode here.) 1. WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REFINANCING AND REPRICING? When you refinance, you are taking out a loan with another institution to pay off your existing loan. Typically, people do this to take advantage of lower interest rates and make savings on their home loan. Repricing, on the other hand, allows home owners to switch to a more competitive loan package within the same institution. Both aim to lower the monthly repayment amount and the interest rate charged for the loan. WATCH: Should I reprice or refinance my housing loan? Money hacks #3 (4:28)  2. REPRICING MAY BE A SAFER BET IF YOU HAVE CHANGED JOBS If you choose to refinance, the new bank would assess your background, ask for your payslips and do a valuation of the property, said Stacked Homes co-founder Ryan Ong. There’s a chance, if your financial situation has changed, that you may not be able to get the same kind of loan that you had before — if you’re earning less, for example. With repricing, there is less paperwork, said Lena Teng, who leads the solutions and investment team at MoneyOwl, a financial adviser and fund management company. “You don’t have to go through the whole hassle of a credit assessment ... legal fees and valuation fee as well as any lock-in (penalty) fee that you might be liable for,” she cited. “Do consider repricing first, before going straight into refinancing.” 3. CALCULATE YOUR REFINANCING COSTS FIRST It is important that home owners compare the two options in terms of cost savings, taking into account the various fees such as the penalty for exiting a lock-in. This lock-in period, usually two to three years, is the length of time during which a penalty is incurred if one pays off a loan in full. Generally speaking, one should not break one’s lock-in period, as the penalty can be substantial. For example, with a S$700,000 loan carrying an interest rate of 1.55 per cent for 25 years, the total interest payable by the end of the loan tenure is S$140,000. If one reprices with the same institution at 1.35 per cent, the total interest payable drops to S$125,000. If another institution is willing to offer an even lower interest rate of 1.25 per cent, the total interest payable drops further to $116,000. A home owner refinancing within his lock-in period, however, would be subject to a repayment fee of 1.5 per cent of the outstanding loan. Including valuation and legal fees, the total refinancing cost would come to $13,000.   In this instance, the nett saving is S$11,000, while repricing offers a potential saving of S$15,000. “Refinancing might cost you around S$2,500 to S$3,000 in conveyance fees, for example. That’s not including other costs,” said Ong. “Repricing might only cost around S$500 to S$800. There are also some people who have free repricing options.” 4. WHAT ABOUT FIXED RATES VERSUS FLOATING RATES? There are generally two types of interest rate structures in the market: Fixed rates and floating rates. The former means the borrower locks in a certain interest rate for a fixed period. A floating rate can be benchmarked against a reference rate that is pegged to transparent market indicators, like the three-month Sibor or the Swap Offer Rate. It can also be pegged to the bank’s board rate or a fixed deposit rate, and this is “usually less transparent”, said Teng. “(A floating rate) is subject to ... greater volatility in the sense that when it changes every one or three months, your monthly repayments would also fluctuate accordingly,” she added.   According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), fixed rate loans are “a good option if interest rates are low when you take out a housing loan, or if you want to budget with certainty over the initial few years of your housing loan”. As for floating rate loans, if the reference rate goes up or down, one’s housing loan interest rate and monthly instalment would vary accordingly, subject to the terms of the loan agreement, the ABS said in a consumer guide on its website. 5. THE SAVINGS CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL When Yeong refinanced his housing loan in 2018, he managed to secure a floating rate of 1.65 per cent. But it spiked to 2.18 per cent last year. Before the year end, he refinanced his loan again, at a fixed rate of 1.89 per cent for the first year, resulting in “quite a significant” S$400 to S$500 saving in monthly mortgage fees, he said. “The extra savings definitely go a long way (towards defraying) the cost of living ... house maintenance as well as — given the COVID situation has (us) working from home — higher utility bills,” he added.   Maybank Singapore head of consumer finance Alan Yet noted that the Singapore dollar three-month Sibor dropped from 2 per cent in June last year to 0.54 per cent this June. “The gap is huge. By refinancing (your home loan) today, you’re likely to save about 60 to 70 basis points, as compared to one year ago,” he said. “Seventy basis points will translate into S$7,000 per year from a (S$1 million) loan outstanding ... That’s very substantial.” Whether one chooses to reprice or refinance, however, the experts advise doing one’s sums before committing to a new mortgage. Watch this episode here.

      " news title: Jobless because of SARS, she built a thriving hostel. Now with COVID-19, it’s closing\n",
      "SINGAPORE: During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, Viji Jagadeesh lost her job when the accounting firm she was working in struggled with poor business. After being jobless for more than a year, she started a small outfit with 12 beds, offering short-term rental to budget travellers. Three years later, Viji opened hostel Mitraa Inn with 60 beds, riding the low-cost aviation boom which saw a spike in budget travellers in Singapore. Her business flourished and, over the years, became one of the largest hostels here, with 144 beds in two shophouses in Serangoon Road.   Mitraa Inn has been particularly hard hit by COVID-19, however, that it is forced to shut down this month. “The past six months have been truly a walk through fire for me,” said its 55-year-old owner. She sensed trouble as early as December, when a group of 44 students from India suddenly cancelled their booking for April. But it did not prepare her for what was to come. “We were thinking, it’s no problem … the travellers will come back,” she recounted. “Then people started cancelling bookings even for September, during the F1 period.” She struggled to fill beds, with occupancy fluctuating between 30 and 40 per cent when the break-even point was 65 per cent.   Sometimes there were as few as five to six people a day, which was “almost as good as zero occupancy”. “I was in denial that it (the closure) was happening. It was mental agony,” said Viji. “But we have no choice (but to close down) before we incur further losses.” It has been a difficult situation not only for her. In an industry that relies on travellers, hostels in Singapore could face a wipe-out. ‘WHEN THE BORDERS CLOSED, WE PANICKED’ Before the borders were closed to short-term visitors in March, Wink Capsule Hostel — with 150 beds in two locations — was running at 80 per cent occupancy, said co-owner Allan Lee. It has been a struggle to survive ever since. “We’re a backpacker hostel. When there are no tourists, we have no business,” he said. In April, a group of 40 hostel owners — with a combined total of 3,000 to 4,000 beds — banded together and formed the Singapore Backpacker’s Hostel Alliance to discuss and keep one another updated on the government’s various COVID-19 measures. “We all could feel that we were entering a pandemic, and we were all affected by the drop in tourists,” said Adler Poh, the group’s spokesman and the managing director of Adler Hostel Singapore. “When the borders closed, we panicked.”   Mitraa Inn was offered a lifeline, said Viji, when it started housing returning foreign domestic workers who were issued with 14-day Stay-Home Notices. “We thought this would be sustainable. We had girls from Myanmar and Philippines. Then the maid arrivals stopped in April as countries closed their borders. Our occupancy dropped again,” she said. Around that period, thousands of Malaysian work pass holders also had to be housed temporarily in Singapore after Malaysia implemented its movement control order on March 18, and many hostels benefited from this. By the time Mitraa Inn was ready for this group in April, however, most of them had already found accommodation in other hostels, said Viji.   CURRENT OCCUPANCY CAP NOT VIABLE But even with these Malaysian workers, hostels like Wink Capsule Hostel had to drop their daily rates from the usual S$35 to cater for this group. “These workers aren’t looking at tourist prices. The market rate is about S$20 today,” said Lee. Had he not lowered his rates, he added, these workers would have rented HDB rooms instead, possibly at a lower monthly price. Then there is competition from some hotels that have even cut their room rates to S$40, which works out at S$20 per person, said Poh. “That leaves us with very little room for manoeuvre,” he said. “With each bed going for S$20 and a monthly revenue of about S$10,000 … how am I going to pay my staff? We’re burning money every day.”   Another problem is that occupancy must be capped at 50 per cent to comply with mandatory safe management measures, which he said is not commercially viable for hostel operators. Bunk beds or capsules, for example, must be allocated in an alternating fashion, while single beds or mattresses must also be spaced at least a metre apart. David Peh, manager of Pine Hostel on Tyrwhitt Road in Jalan Besar, said that because of the 50 per cent rule, the hostel has had to turn away guests like Malaysian workers. “We’re struggling to break even,” he said. “We’re waiting for the government to do something (to revise the rule).” The hostel has survived so far because the landlord had given it rental waivers, he added. “The next few months will be the real test (without the waivers).” If the 50 per cent rule is still strictly adhered to and landlords do not budge on negotiating rents going forward, Poh believes “many of the hostels will close down”.   “We’re in such a difficult situation now … We haven’t been viable for a long time,” he said. “(Many of us) try to balance our costs, but we’re reaching the end of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS).” The overall shortfall for Wink Capsule Hostel, said Lee, is now “a few thousand dollars every month”. He added: “We’re trying to hang on till the end of the year. If (we) can’t, we’ll close down.” JEWELLERY PAWNED, FLAT DOWNGRADED For Mitraa Inn, Viji said she started closing floors over the last few months to save on electricity and manpower costs. “In July, we had only eight guests. We couldn’t even pay the Internet (bill),” she said. She had to pawn some of her jewellery and downgrade from a Towner Road flat to one in Bukit Panjang so that the company would have enough money to refund those who had cancelled their bookings, she shared.   While her landlord had passed on the rental waivers to her in the last couple of months, Viji figured she could not hope to sustain her business with a monthly rental of S$45,000 and Singapore’s borders remaining closed. “The hostel business isn’t just about the rental; the utilities are hefty, and there are also maintenance and pest control bills,” she added. “There are also the salaries of employees, even with the JSS.” She has not laid off any of her 16 employees, she said, as the landlord has expressed interest in taking over the business and may hire them. But her husband, who quit his IT job to help her run Mitraa Inn, has to look for a job next.   The pandemic has also claimed her three other businesses located within the hostel: A flower shop, a supermarket and a travel agency that also relied on tourists for income. Spending 15 years in a business where she has had to be on call 24/7 has been “very tiring” for Viji. Her children, a son aged 23 and a daughter aged 15, have urged her to take a six-month sabbatical. However, coming full circle and jobless again, she is already thinking of what to do next: Either sell properties or open a maid agency, as she has a real estate salesperson licence and an employment agency licence too. She may even have the energy to open another hostel, “maybe in one or two years’ time”. “But one with a smaller capacity, maybe 50 to 60 beds,” she added. “We shall see.” This is one of several CNA Insider stories on micro SMEs in different sectors that have closed or changed drastically amid COVID-19.

      " news title: Not all face masks are created equal — 7 things to consider to protect yourself\n",
      "SINGAPORE: Surgical masks are one of the most sought-after items in the world now. Even with ST Engineering producing surgical masks here since February – after a foreign supplier could not fulfil its contractual obligations to Singapore – these are available only to front-line healthcare workers. But there are alternatives out there. In the past few months, many people, from scientists to tailors, have tried to develop face masks that are both comfortable and safe. Not all masks, however, are created equal. There are disposable three-layer masks, carbon filter masks, silicone masks, and even masks made of copper or nano-silver, said to kill viruses and bacteria. With so many masks on the market, ranging in price from about 40 cents to S$76, this raises the question of how effective they each are. The programme Talking Point finds out what science says about various masks — and seven things people should consider to protect themselves. (Watch the episode here.)   1. DISPOSABLE MASKS MAY NOT BE MEDICAL-GRADE Although there are many disposable masks, and some are labelled surgical masks, not all conform to international standards, said Gareth Tang, senior vice-president of technology and head of Innosparks at ST Engineering. Tang, who led the setting up of its surgical mask production line in just two weeks, said the company has “stringent, end-to-end quality control” to ensure that its surgical masks are medical-grade. This includes testing how breathable the masks are and how efficient the layers of filtration are. The bacterial filtration efficiency of a surgical mask must be above 95 per cent, and it must be resistant to the penetration of bodily fluids, according to the Health Sciences Authority. So the efficiency reading of 98 per cent for ST Engineering's mask material marks a level that “blocks 98 per cent of bacteria and viruses, and that includes the COVID-19 virus, through the mask”, Tang noted. The company is now working on making its masks more widely available, he said. “We hope to bring this mask to the general public in the near term.”   2. COPPER AND SILVER CAN KILL BACTERIA The most expensive masks are those containing copper or silver. In ancient times, the Egyptians used these metals to treat wounds, noted Lam Yeng Ming, professor and chair of materials science and engineering at Nanyang Technological University. So copper and silver “have been shown to kill bacteria”. “They’re effective in some circumstances,” she said. That includes viruses, provided the copper or silver ions interact with the virus. For example, when a virus lands on a copper surface, the metal’s ions attack and kill the cells. But this process takes time, anywhere from 30 minutes to a day. Another problem is that some face masks with copper woven into the fabric have spaces between the copper fibres. “Between these lines, you can fit quite a lot of the virus,” she said. “If this spacing is hundreds of microns, essentially it can’t filter out (viruses).” A nano-silver mask Talking Point sent to her to examine, however, was found to be fully coated with the metal, so the virus “should come into contact with these silver surfaces”. While nano-silver and copper have shown to be effective against different viruses, she said tests specific to the virus that causes COVID-19 are key. “That has to be conclusive. There are some studies being done, but I think more studies need to be done,” she added. WATCH: Reusable or surgical — which is the right mask for you? (22:25)  3. STUDIES LACKING ON CARBON FILTER MASKS TOO Some manufacturers claim that masks with a carbon filter are effective in filtering out bacteria and viruses. Carbon filters are widely used in air purifiers to absorb and capture smoke and other gaseous pollutants — but they are not any more effective than other masks when it comes to the coronavirus. “A carbon filter mask is effective (against) air pollutants, but for bacteria and for viruses, there definitely haven’t been many studies to show its effectiveness,” said Lam.   4. DO HOME-MADE MASKS WORK? The second government-issued reusable mask has antibacterial properties. But like some people, Chrissandra Chong finds that “it sticks too closely to my face for me to breathe easily”. The freelance branding consultant sews her own masks — with “adjustable ear loops” to cater for different face shapes and designed to be more breathable. She has made more than 200 masks since February, and volunteers for Masks Sewn with Love, a grassroots initiative that has provided over 100,000 masks for vulnerable groups. But are do-it-yourself masks good enough? According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal fabric mask should have at least three layers: An innermost layer of absorbent material like cotton and two other layers made of water-resistant material such as polypropylene. 5. AIRTIGHT MASKS CAN CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION N95 respirators can also be made from soft silicone material, which effectively creates a seal on one’s face. But because it can “offer relatively airtight protection”, using this type of mask can lead to skin irritation, said Eileen Tan, a dermatologist who runs her own practice, Eileen Tan Skin Clinic and Associates. “It may not be suitable for everyday use or for people with sensitive skin,” she added.   6. HOW YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN Tan has seen a 15 to 20 per cent increase in the number of patients seeking help for mask-related skin problems. One can get skin inflammation, for example, from the build-up of moisture, heat and increase in sebum production, which can lead to clogged pores, she said. She recommends changing one’s mask every four to six hours “if you can afford to”, and taking “mask breaks” of about 15 to 30 minutes to “allow your skin to rest”. “Consider things like a cloth mask, which is a more breathable kind of fabric (and) more comfortable,” she added.   7. KEEP GOOD MASK-WEARING HABITS Senior consultant Kalisvar Marimuthu from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases uses five reusable masks each week. It is important, he said, to wash one’s mask every day, as that removes not only viruses, but also saliva stains and dust particles on the mask. He also advises against touching the front of the mask when removing it, as the chances are people would touch their nose or mouth after that. Watch this episode of Talking Point here.
